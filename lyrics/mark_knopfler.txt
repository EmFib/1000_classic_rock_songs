I'm going to San Bernardino, ring-a-ding-ding
Milkshake mixers, that's my thing now
These guys bought a heap of my stuff
And I gotta see a good thing sure enough now
Or my name is not Kroc, it's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile but not spelt that way now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that
Folks line up all down the street
Now I am seeing this girl devour her meat now
And then I get it--wham--as clear as day
My pulse begins to hammer then I hear a voice say
These boys have got this down
Ought to be one of these in every town
These boys have got the touch
It's clean as a whistle and it don't cost much
Wham bam, don't wait long
Shake fries patty - you're gone
And how about that friendly name
Heck, every little thing gotta stay the same
You gentlemen ought to expand
You're gonna need a helping hand now
So gentlemen, well, what about me?
We'll make a little business history now
Or my name's not Kroc, call me Ray
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that
Well, we'll build it up and I'll buy them out
But man they made me grind it out now
They open up a new place flippin' meat
So I do too, right across the street
I got the main I need the town
They sell up in the end and it all shuts down
Sometimes you gotta be an S.O.B
If you wanna make a dream reality
Competition, sent 'em south
If they're gonna drown put a hose in their mouth
Do not pass "Go", go straight to hell
I smell that meat hook smell
Or my name is not Kroc that's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way now
Ohh, it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Dog eat dog, rat eat rat now
Ohh, it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that5:15 AM
Snow laying all around
A collier cycles home
From his night shift underground
Past the silent pub
Primary school, workingmens club
On the road from the pithead
The churchyard packed
With mining dead
Then beneath the bridge
He comes to a giant car
A shroud of snow upon the roof
A Mark X Jaguar
He thought the man was fast asleep
Silent, still and deep
Both dead and cold
Shot through
With bullet holes
The one armed bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from Cockneyland
E-type jags and flashy suits
Put your money in
Pull the levers
Watch them spin
Cash cows in all the pubs
But he preferred the new nightclubs
Nineteen sixty-seven
Bandit men in Birdcage heaven
La dolce vita, sixty-nine
All new to people of the Tyne
Who knows who did what
Somebody made a call
They said his hands
Were in the pot
That he'd been skimming hauls
He picks up the swag
They gaily gave away
Drives his giant jag
Off to his big pay day
The bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from Cockneyland
E-type jags and flashy suits
The bandit man
Came up the Great North Road
Up to Geordieland
To mine
The mother lode
Seams blew up or cracked
Black diamonds came hard won
Generations toiled and hacked
For a pittance and black lung
Crushed by tub or stone
Together
And alone
How the young and old
Paid the price of coal
Eighteen sixty-seven
My angel's gone to heaven
He'll be happy there
Sunlight and sweet clean air
They gather round the glass
Tough hewers and crutters
Child trappers and putters
The little foals and half-marrows
Who pushed
And pulled the barrows
The hod boys
And the rolleywaymen
5:15 AMIt's the end of a perfect day
For all surfer boys and girls
The sun's dropping down in the bay
And fallin' off the world
There's a diamond in the sky
Our evening stone
In our Shangri-La, oh
Get that fire burnin' strong
Right here and right now
It's here and then it's gone
There's no secret anyhow
We may never love again
To the music of guitars
In our Shangri-La
Tonight your beauty burns
Into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns
Above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our Shangri-La, oh
Tonight your beauty burns
Into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns
Above us endlessly
But this is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our Shangri-La
In our Shangri-La
In our Shangri-LaA million miles our vagabond heels
Clocked up beneath the clouds
They're counting down to show time
When we do it for real with the crowds
Air miles are owing
But they don't come for free
And they don't give you any for pain
But if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain
The rimshots come down like cannon fire
And thunder off the wall
There's a man in every corner
And each one is giving his all
This is my piper
This is my drum
So you never will hear me complain
And if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain
All the roadrunning
All the roadrunning
Well if you're inclined
To go up on the wall
It can only be fast and high
And those who don't like the danger
Soon find something different to try
When there's only a ringin' in your ears
And an echo down memory lane
But if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
The show's packing up
I sit and watch the convoy
Leaving town
There's no pretending I'm not a fool
For riding around and around
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death
You showed me one time on the plane
But if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain
A million miles of vagabond sky
Clocked up above the clouds
I'm still your man for the roaming
For as long as there's roamin' allowed
There'll be a rider
And there'll be a wall
As long as the dreamer remains
And if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunningSo many mouths to feed on the farm
And Sonny was the second to the last one born
His Mamma ran away and his daddy beat him bad
And he grew up wild, good love he never had
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
Well he hung with the hoods, he wouldn't stroke the fans
But he had dynamite in both his hands
Boom bam like the slammer door
The bell and the can and the bodies on the floor
Beware
The Bear's in town
Somebody's money says the Bear's going down
Yeah, the Bear never smiles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
Yeah
The writers didn't like him the fight game jocks
With his lowlife backers and his hands like rocks
They didn't want to have a bogey man
They didn't like him and he didn't like them
Black Cadillac, Alligator boots
Money in the pockets of his shark skin suits
Some say the Bear took a flop
They couldn't believe it when they saw him drop
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
Yeah
Joe Louis was his hero, he tried to be the same
But a criminal child wears a ball and chain
So the civil rights people didn't want him on the throne
And the hacks and the cops wouldn't leave him alone
At the foot of his bed with his feet on the floor
There was dope in his veins and a pistol on the drawer
One lone investigation as such
He hated needles but he knew too much
Criss crossed on his back
Scars from his daddy like slavery tracks
The second last child was the second last King
Never again was it the same in the ring
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
Yeah
They never could be sure about the day he was born
A motherless child set to working on the farm
And they never could be sure about the day he died
The Bear was the King, they cast asideWe're taking on the water, diesel and stores
Layin' up awhile before I'm back on board
They're patching her up
To go fishin' again, fishin' again
Weldin' her rudder, scrubbin' her keel
Scars on her belly need time to heal
In the dock
With the trawlermen
I know all the people
There's nobody new
Soon we'll be leavin' with the same old crew
On the greener water
The tumbling sea
They ain't running like the good old days
Time's just slipping down the old slipways
In the dock
So dear to me
Dark is the night
And I need a guiding light to keep me
From founderin' on the rocks
My only prayer
Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering back in the dock
La
Lalala
Laa lala
Laa lala
I could use a layoff getting my strength back
But there's a loan to pay off and a few skipjack
So it's a turnaround
Back in the southerly wind, southerly wind
Pirates coming in to steal our gold
You can count yourself lucky with a profit in the hold
In the dock
When we come in
Dark is the night
And I need a guiding light to keep me
From founderin' on the rocks
My only prayer
Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering back in the dock
Back in the dock
Laa lala
Laa lalaOne thing was leading to the next
I bit off more than I could chew
I had the power to sign the checks
It wasn't difficult to do
I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
I robbed a bank full of dinero
A great big mountain of dough
So it was goodbye Compa√±ero
And cheerio
I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
I never meant to be a cheater
But there was blood on the wall
But I had to steal from Peter
To pay what I owed to Paul
I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
From ParaguayYon's my privateer
See how trim she lies
To every man a lucky hand
And every man a prize
I live to ride the ocean
The mighty world around
To take a little plunder
And to hear the cannon sound
To lay with pretty women
To drink Madeira wine
To hear the rollers thunder
On a shore that isn't mine
Privateering, oh we will go
Privateering, yo ho ho ho
Privateering we will go
Yo ho ho, yo ho ho
The people on your man o' war
Are treated worse than scum
I'm no flogging captain
And by God I've sailed with some
Come with me to Barbary
We'll ply there up and down
Not quite exactly
In the service of the Crown
To lay with pretty women
To drink Madeira wine
To hear the rollers thunder
On a shore that isn't mine
Privateering, oh we will go
Privateering, yo ho ho ho
Privateering we will go
Yo ho ho, yo ho ho
Look'ee there's my privateer
She's small but she can sting
Licensed to take prizes
With a letter from the King
I love the streets and taverns
Of a pretty foreign town
I tip my hat to the dark-eyed ladies
As we sally up and down
To lay with pretty women
To drink Madeira wine
To hear the rollers thunder
On a shore that isn't mine
Privateering, oh we will go
Privateering, yo ho ho ho
Privateering we will go
Yo ho ho, yo ho ho
Britannia needs her privateers
Each time she goes to war
Death to all her enemies
Though prizes matter more
Come with me to Barbary
We'll ply there up and down
Not quite exactly
In the service of the Crown
To lay with pretty women
To drink Madeira wine
To hear the rollers thunder
On a shore that isn't mine
Privateering, oh we will go
Privateering, yo ho ho ho
Privateering we will go
Yo ho ho, yo ho hoFlash goes a little hummingbird a dart and worried thread
At the screen door by his lemon tree out here with the quick and the dead
Designer blinds above LA frame the perfect view
It's gonna be another day of sun and shameless blue
By his cutting block the time has come for the fruit there by the juicer
He grinds fresh coffee for himself he's beaten our producer
LA Times lies on the stone warming there like bread
Hey what's not to like out here with the quick and the dead?
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
You wanna know what happiness is? In his eye lives a hunter's gleam
Something to look forward to, this cat's gonna get the cream
Skin of a mango is so smooth , smoother than the devil
Cut it, slice it, chop it up to the rhythm of a cockney rebel
Back in Blighty there's a flat on a grimy sink estate
That's why he walked out of that and went to the Golden State
Left the backie and the beer where he was born and bred
Now he's cutting it out here with the quick and the dead
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
What would you have had him do
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two yeah
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two yeahHunted down, I came upon
A place of ferns and grass
Gathered to a redbud tree
And now their footsteps pass
Where I crouch in dread
Discovery my certain death
Her leaves reaching for my head
As I suspend my breath
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Those days of fear are gone
Yet I am pledged to her
As to my only one
My lovely protector
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter meDon't often open up this floor
Since I handed in, my gun
What all these keys are for
Now my tour of duty's done
You got to know the switches
Now you got your turn
Watch and learn, junior
Watch and learn
Now you will get your trouble spots
Here's one from down voodoo way
Bragged he had me by the you know what's
Very funny, you don't say
The big Enchilada, stealin' elections
Had to go down there, trash collection
Got his cojones on my desk in there
Made into a souvenir
Set of cufflinks, nice pair
The rest of him's, someplace up here
Sometimes you got to put a shoulder to the door
Not so fast, junior
Listen to your pa
Here, son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
Whatever you do
What we have here's a dung hole place
Thought it was fly shit on the map
Fat bastard, ugly face, ooh and the personal crap
You can't move the barriers, you can't mess with oil and gas
Had to go down there, stick a couple aircraft carriers in his ass
Fancy dress, medals chest, it's all in here, for all the gigs
Gas mask bulletproof vest, all the usual rigs
There'll be things they missed, they didn't mention
You've even got a whistle in there for attracting attention
Well, I think you're gonna be okay, son
If I had the tour, I guess
These two buttons by the way
This one I hope you never press
Some holy fool, just watch, not like you or me
That one's the whole shootin' match
Right there, it's the whole shitaree
We don't forget who put us here, Jack
That's page one we talk soft
Carry a big stick, pack the biggest gun
We don't like accidents major or minor
You don't want yourself an incident
Don't ever invade China
Here, son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
Ohh, here son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
Whatever you doSouthern bound from Glasgow town, she's shining in the sun
I'm ensconced in mercy, on the border run
We're whistling down the hillsides and tearing up the climbs
I'm just a thiever, stealing time
In the Border Reiver
Three hundred thousand on the clock and plenty more to go
Crashbox and lever, she needs the heel and toe
Shes not too cold in winter but she cooks me in the heat
I'm a six foot driver but you can adjust the seat
In the Border Reiver
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
She's an Albion, she's an Albion
The ministry don't worry me my paperworks alright
They can't touch me, I got my sleep last night
Its knocking out a living wage in nineteen sixty nine
I'm just a thiever, stealing time
In the Border reiver
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
Sure as the sunrise, that's what they say about the Albion
She's an Albion, she's an AlbionWhen I was just a boy I‚Äôd be kicking a tin
Take the short cut home through the loony bin
I never gave much thought to the souls in there
I was just a boy, too young to care
Well the years go by and you get to see
A dream‚Äôs not the same as reality
Well a dream or two is going to crash and burn
And that‚Äôs the way that you live and learn
Well it was late one night and I woke at two
And I lay there thinking the way you do
But it‚Äôs a long dark night of the soul
When those thoughts are turning sad and old
And then outside on the empty street
I heard the sound of walking feet
Well it was just a boy away from home
And he was singing the song 'You'll Never Walk Alone'After two thousands came thousands and one
To be the new champions, we were there for to run
From springtime in Arizona, 'til the fall in Monterey
And the raceways were the battlefields and we fought 'em all the way
It was in Phoenix in the morning, I had a wakeup call
She went around the without a warning and put me in the wall
I drove at Long Beach California with three cracked vertebrae
And we went on the Indianapolis, Indiana; in May
Well, the Brickyard's there to crucify anyone who will not learn
I climbed a mountain to qualify ran flat through the turns
And I was down in the might-have-beens and an old pal good as died
And I sat down in gasoline alley and I cried
Well we were in at the kill again on the Milwaukee Mile
And in June up in Michigan we were robbed at Belle Isle
Then It was on to Portland Oregon for the G. I. Joe
And I blew off almost everyone when I my motor let go
New England, Ontario we died in the dirt
Those walls from Mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurt
So we came to Road America where we burned up at the lake
But at the Speedway At Nazareth I made no mistakeWhen you leave
There's cordite in the air
A ringing in the stillness
Smoke drifting up the stair
When you leave
When you leave
My heart sounds in my ears
A beating in the darkness
A trace of you still here
When you leave
When you leave
Like it or not
How could I not have fallen for you?
And now that I‚Äôm caught
How could I not be blue?
When you leave
I'll hear the smallest sound
And turn to look behind me
As though you're still around
When you leave
When you leavePennies from heaven, don't make me laugh
Here all you'll get's the patterin' rain
Or yon two crows up over the hill
Lookin' for winter kill
Always at your boots, the mud behind the byre
With its clammy hold
Would mock you up a grave here in the mire
Of a wrecked sheepfold
And all you'll bring to this is muscle and grit
Persistence, that's just about it
What made you think there'd be a livin' in sheep?
Eat, work, eat, work and sleep
Duck under the eaves of the bothy
To sit here, caged by rain
Somewhere to go, conjure a next move
When I have to think again
The dog lifts his gaze to plead
Believes the wizard has a magic stick
Leans his weight into my tweed
I give an unholy hand to lick
I take a swig of sheep dip from my flask
And once again I ask
What made you think there'd be a livin' in sheep?
Eat, work, eat, work and sleep
They were at this game two hundred years ago
Thirty ways of dyin' young, poor souls
Laid to rest in their soggy rows
Rain on their holy books
Blood and whisky on the tongue
No-one watchin' over anyone
No-one left but your stubborn one
And the crows and rooks
Ah, the dyin' young
Well, I'm not done
You watch me and I'll watch thee
I can still work for two men and drink for three
I raise my flask to the clearin' skies
To you, sweepers, you carrion spies
To scavenge and survive
If you can do it, so can IWhen I leave this world behind me
To another I will go
If there are no pipes in heaven
I'll be going down below
If friends in time be severed
Someday we will meet again
I'll return to leave you never
Be a piper to the end
This has been a day to die for
Now the day has almost done
Up above a choir of seabirds
Turns to face the setting sun
Now the evening dawn is calling
And all the hills are burning red
And before the night comes falling
Clouds are lined with golden thread
We watched the fires together
Shared our quarters for a while
Walked the dusty roads together
Came so many miles
This has been a day to die on
Now the day is almost done
Here the pipes will lay beside me
Silent will the battle drum
If friends in time be severed
Someday here we will meet again
I return to leave you never
Be a piper to the endAround the time of Clambake
Movie number twenty five
You and the lying Dutchman
Are still in overdrive
You're strong as when you started
Mississippi in your soul
You can still be Marlon Brando
And the King of Rock 'n' Roll
It isn't just the records
No, you must have Hollywood
The songs alone are not enough
That much is understood
You'll soon be back in Memphis
Maybe then you'll know what to do
The story lines they're giving you
Are just not ringing true
Oh, it's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
It's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
When you're young and beautiful
Your dreams are all ideal
Later on it's not the same
Lord, everythin' is real
Sixteen hundred miles of highway
Roll back to the truth
And a song to give your mother
In your first recordin' booth
Around the time of Clambake
That old dream's still rollin' on
Sometimes there'll be the feelin'
Things are going wrong
Mornin' star is fadin'
Lord, Mississippi's cold
You can still be Marlon Brando
And the King of Rock 'n' Roll
Oh, it's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
It's ways to go
Back to TupeloHand me down my high roller Stetson
Hand me down my smokeless .41
We‚Äôre gonna look so sharp when we walk in
They‚Äôre gonna be jazzed we come
We‚Äôre going for the major comeback
For the motherlode, the mighty score
We‚Äôll be the toast of every knocked out boogie shack
Now we‚Äôre back on the dancefloor
Going all the way is the only way to go
The only game in town
Shake your moneymaker closer to the floor
Shake ‚Äòem on down, shake 'em on down
Hand me down my two-tone wingtips
Hand me down my skull head walking cane
You all gotta wear them shantung gambler suits
They‚Äôre gonna be jazzed we came
We‚Äôre going for the major comeback
For the motherlode, the mighty score
We‚Äôll be the toast of every knocked out boogie shack
Now we‚Äôre back on the dancefloor
Going all the way is the only way to go
The only game in town
Shake your moneymaker closer to the floor
Shake ‚Äòem on down, shake 'em on down
We‚Äôre going for the major comeback
For the motherlode, the mighty score
We‚Äôll be the toast of every knocked out boogie shack
Now we‚Äôre back on the dancefloorWe are leaving, leaving
Leaving on the tide
Come and stand beside me love
The water is so wide
You can hear the sailors calling
At the dawning of the day
Yesterday is falling, love
And je suis desole, je suis desole
Je suis d√©sol√©, mais je n'ai pas le choix
Je suis d√©sol√©, mais la vie me demande √ßa
I am turning, turning
From a land that I loved well
Look ahead my darling one
Across the rolling swell
And you can hear the seagulls crying
As we're slipping out of the bay
Yesterday is dying, love
And je suis d√©sol√©, je suis d√©sol√©
We are sailing, sailing
For a land that's proud and free
I had no more endurance
For what had become of me
And I will do that which I must do, love
And now we're under way
All that I can say to you
Is je suis d√©sol√©We've paid in hell since Moscow burned
As Cossacks tear us piece by piece
Our dead are strewn a hundred leagues
Though death would be a sweet release
And our grande arm√©e is dressed in rags
A frozen starving beggar band
Like rats we steal each other's scraps
Fall to fighting hand to hand
Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with Bonaparte
What dreams he made for us to dream
Spanish skies, Egyptian sands
The world was ours, we marched upon
Our little Corporal's command
And I lost an eye at Austerlitz
The sabre slash yet gives me pain
My one true love awaits me still
The flower of the Aquitaine
I pray for her who prays for me
A safe return to my belle France
We prayed these wars would end all wars
In war we know is no romance
And I pray our child will never see
A little Corporal again
Point toward a foreign shore
Captivate the hearts of menMy whistle under the archways
Still echoes down the street
All the way back to Deptford days
Nights down by The Creek
Notes as big as river boats
Still echoing through the clubs
With the horns of the trains
Down the old back lanes
And the lights of the corner pubs
In a taproom lined with mirrors
There‚Äôs a man there at the bar
Reminds you of somebody
He says I know who you are
He‚Äôs right, I know I could be him
But anyway who is who?
You could be looking at
What he‚Äôs looking at
And he‚Äôs looking at you
And I‚Äôll be out of this place
And down the road wherever
There but for the grace, etcetera
I‚Äôll see you later but it‚Äôs 1979
And I‚Äôm picking my way out of here
One song at a time
The slaving ports of plunder
Used to stink to heaven on high
Companions of honour
Always were in short supply
The Bristol ships and Liverpool‚Äôs
On every tide they came
The times they may have changed, my friend
Some people stay the same
And I‚Äôll be out of this place
And down the road wherever
There but for the grace, etcetera
I‚Äôll see you later but it‚Äôs 1879
And I‚Äôm picking my way out of here
One song at a time
A grinning mogul greets the crowd
At Execution Dock
All come to see three mutineers
Turned off at twelve o'clock
The shyster takes a ringside seat
As they‚Äôre bringing them from the jail
And twenty thousand tickets
Sold online on premium sale
So if you need to reach me
You can leave word at The Pig
I have no wish to stay around
To watch that Newgate jig
Or any more poor old fakers
Trying to dance in my old shoes
I‚Äôll be gone over the ocean
With the transatlantic blues
And I‚Äôll be out of this place
And down the road wherever
There but for the grace, etcetera
I‚Äôll see you later somewhere down the line
I‚Äôll be picking my way out of here

MK: I was stoned on love, I guess
You and me, we were meant to me
This is us 
BOTH: This is us on our honeymoon

MK: With our pride and joy
EH: You at the Sunday game
EH: Standing next to whats-his-name
MK: On our anniversary
MK: With the family
You and me and our memories
This is us Its the end of a perfect day for all the surfer boys and girls
The suns dropping down in the bay and falling off the world
There's a diamond in the sky, our evening stone in our shangri-la
Get that fire burning strong right here and right now
Its here and then its gone, theres no secret anyhow
We may never love again to the music of guitars in our shangri-la
Tonight your beauty burns into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we got, right here where we are in our shangri-la
Tonight your beauty burns into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we got, right here where we are in our shangri-la
In our shangri-la
In our shangri-laThe ragged kid nobody wanted
Left alone to ramble wild
Long ago he was abandoned
Nobody's child
Never smiles and never chatters
Never quarrels or complains
Grown as hard as the Sierras
And the Western Plains
Come a‚Äôcow cow yicky yicky yea
A'come a'cow cow yicky yicky yea
Learned to swing a broken bottle
Learned to use his fists and knife
In the bar rooms and bordellos
Of his life
He drifted down towards the borders
The sky was dark but it did not rain
Came the meanest pistoleros
In the Western Plains
He fell in with these desperadoes
Thieves and killers every one
Prizes hanging from their saddles
With their guns
Come a‚Äôcow cow yicky yicky yea
A'come a'cow cow yicky yicky yea
The ragged kid nobody wanted
Left alone to ramble wild
Now he rides beside the Devil
Nobody's child
Come a'cow cow yicky yicky yea
A'come a'cow cow yicky yicky yeaHeard a bell being toll
Before the break of day
I heard then my name being called
Down that long highway
You don't get long
You don't get long
You don't get long to stay
Kiss me once and I'll be gone
Down that long highway
Spirits call from way beyond
Lord I may not disobey
Spare a thought for the vagabond
Down that long highway
Down that long highway
Down that long highwayThey had a last supper the day of the beaching
She's a dead ship sailing skeleton crew
The galley is empty, the stove pots are cooling
What's left of the stew
The time is approaching, the captain moves over
The hangman steps in to do what he's paid for
With the wind down the tide
She goes proud ahead steaming
And he drives her hard into the shore
So far from the Clyde
Together we ride
We did ride
As if to a wave from her bows to her rudder
Bravely she rises to meet with the land
Under their feet you can feel her keel shudder
The shallow sea washes their hands
Later the captain shakes hands with the hangman
Climbs slowly down to the oily wet ground
Goes back to the car that has come here to take him
Through the graveyard back to the town
So far from the 
Together we ride
We did ride
They pull out her cables and hack off her hatches
Too poor to be wasteful with pity or time
They swarm on her carcass with torches and axes
Like a whale on a bloody shoreline
Stripped of her pillars her stays and her stanchions
When it's only her bones on the wet poison land
Steel ropes will drag her with winches and engines
'Til it's only a stain on the sea
So far from the 
Together we ride
We did ride
So far from the 
Together we ride
We did rideWe run along easy at periscope depth
Sun dappling through clear water
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Far away from the slaughter
Your hair is a strawflower that sings in the sun
My darling, my beautiful daughter
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Cast away on the water
From down in the vault, down in the grave
Reaching up to the light on the waves
So she did run to him over the grass
She fell in his arms and he caught her
So went the dream of the drowned submariner
Far away on the water
Far away on the waterI got shot off my horse
So what? I'm up again
Playin' in one of these big saloons on main
You can come up here take a look around these sinners dens
You're only ever goin' to find
One or two real games
Nobody's drivin' me underground
Not yet anyway
But either on the strip or on the edge of town
Everybody pays
Everybody pays to play
Yeah, you ought to stay right where you are in Sawdust Land
It's probably the safest place to be
With your greasy little pork pies
And your shoestring hands
Makes no difference to me
All those directions which we never took
To go our different ways
Who went and wrote the oldest story in the book?
Curl up inside a boxcar dream and disappear
With a couple low roller friends
You were never one for trouble
So get out of here
I knew the game was dangerous back then
But nobody's breezin' through these swingin' doors
Just ups and walks away
Everybody has to leave some blood here on the floorThe trapper man‚Äôs in from the hinterlands
Filth and grease on his clothes and hands
From the outermost, the farthermost
Comes riding in to the trading post
Got a pack horse loaded up with hides
Steps in to see the man inside
I got furs, skins, a little meat too
Here, I got a good piece just for you
You take this home to give the wife
The trapper draws his skinning knife
Now the fat man‚Äôs desk is a butcher‚Äôs block
The trapper cuts the meat and talks
You‚Äôre gonna lose your shirt on a nowhere man
Lose your shirt in nowhere land
Back out there is my country
And you best let this trapper be the trapper
You need the trapper man
The trapper man
If you don‚Äôt want to be where lightning strikes
Better let me work the way I like
You don‚Äôt want to know how I fill my sacks
You go out there you don‚Äôt come back
You got nature red in tooth and claw
And you ain‚Äôt got no rule of law
And if you don‚Äôt know nature‚Äôs way
All that‚Äôs gonna stop you being the prey is the trapper
You need the trapper man
The trapper man
You wanna wear them gems and rings
You wanna show off them shiny things
Shake your money maker, bro
Where the movers and the shakers go
You wanna go do what you do
Let the gold and silver come to you
I need you but you need me
So you best let this trapper be the trapper
You need the trapper man
The trapper man
When he‚Äôs done his thing and gone his way
The fat men light cigars and say
‚ÄúHoly smokes did you see that?
We all made money on the trapper cat‚Äù
Sit back in their big ass chairs
Say, ‚ÄúBoys, that is the man right there‚Äù
I‚Äôm the lifeline for your big soft ass
It‚Äôs the trapper puts it in first class, the trapper
You need the trapper man
The trapper manThere‚Äôs laughter in the darkness
Music floating in across the bay
He‚Äôs half listening and wondering
How he could have let her slip away
So long ago but still he wants to know
If anyone has seen her
And he‚Äôs sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
They were young and love was shining
Like the colours of the rainbow
Desire felt like choking
Love was smoking under the volcano
He can still taste her kisses
Sweet as the red wine from Messina
Now he‚Äôs sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
Seems like another lifetime
When they rambled along the shore
Seems like another lifetime
She used to call him her sweet senor
Maybe in another lifetime
On a pathway to the sea
Maybe there they‚Äôll be
The crowd calls for the emperor
Raise their hands to hail another king
But he‚Äôs been so long a wanderer
Another crowd can never mean a thing
He came, he saw, he conquered
Ten thousand voices roared in the arena
Now he‚Äôs sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
He hears the chimes of history
Myths of gods and men forever ringing
Ancient dreams in all their mystery
Wars for Sicily and Spartan women
In the mists of antiquity
Ships of war set sail from Carthagina
Now he‚Äôs sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
Sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of TaorminaBrew the coffee in a bucket
Double straight man and banjo
If you don't got the snake oil
Buster, you don't got a show
Who puts the do re me in our pockets
Keeps the party goin' on?
It's the man who sells the potions
I'm just the one who plays the songs
Now they generally buys
The bigger size
They usually rub it in
I drank it once, it tasted
Like grease and paraffin
It's mostly alcohol, okay
You can't deny it's strong
We was goin' through the motions
'Til the doctor came along
There stands the bottle
Ladies and gentlemen
All these bottles
Don't have to tell you, friends
These days miracles
Don't come fallin' from the sky
Raise your glasses to the doctor
To a stand up guy
When the monkey shine is flyin'
And he's promisin' the cure
He says the French for your lovesick blues
La maladie d'amour
He gets the chumps all laughin'
But he gets a few to buy
Here's a beefsteak when you're hungry
And whiskey when you're dry
Now the band'll blow their moolah
Like sailors gone ashore
Now we're goin' to West Helena
To gamble, drink and whore
Let's you and me all make whoopee
Here's mud in your eye
Here's to all the gals he ever want
And Heaven when you die
There's a big cheese with a cigar
Been sizin' up the show
He wants to get the doctor
Pitchin' on the radio
I will make a switch to guitar
But the rules all still apply
They want to trust somebody
Yeah, they want a stand up guy
There stands the bottle
Here's to absent friends
All these bottles
Dead soldiers in the end
These days miracles
Don't come falling from the sky
Raise your glasses to the doctor
To a stand up guy
To the doctor
A stand up guyLaughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared
Well, the holes in the walls
Were such a lot
Welcome to London town
But when you‚Äôre new to it all
And you think you‚Äôre hot
You‚Äôre not planning on hanging around
People would go on their different ways
I left to start a band
A note came through the letter box
In your childlike hand
One day I rode to where you were
The doorbell jangled a note
They buzzed me in
I climbed the stairs
In my boots and leather coat
There‚Äôs an old brass
Standing there at the top
Without her witch‚Äôs broom
It almost seemed like a knocking shop
When the girls came out of their rooms
And they all stood around
And stared at me
Two brunettes and a blonde
Then the old brass shrugged and said
We don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs gone
Later on I picked up the ball
And I took off down the line
I suppose by then I‚Äôd realised
You‚Äôd run into hard timesI am Jeremiah Dixon
I am a Geordie boy
A glass of wine with you, sir
And the ladies I'll enjoy
All Durham and Northumberland
Is measured up by my own hand
It was my fate from birth
To make my mark upon the earth
He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society
We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
The Mason-Dixon Line
Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois
Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun
A new morning has begun
Another day will make it clear
Why your stars should guide us here
We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
The Mason-Dixon Line
The Mason-Dixon LineNarrator:
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that"
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?
Romeo:
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die"
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
Narrator:
And a lovestruck Romeo he sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
And says something like, "You and me babe, how 'bout it?"
Romeo:
"You and me babe, how about it?"It‚Äôs a drover‚Äôs road
High up where ravens fly
And soon I‚Äôll lose my way
And I won‚Äôt know
It‚Äôs a drover‚Äôs road
From days so long gone by
When we knew who we were
And where to go
It‚Äôs a drover‚Äôs road
It winds a hundred miles
You‚Äôd sleep out in the open
Calm and still
You could trust a friend
To keep a watch awhile
Your cattle grazing
Quiet on the hill
Walk with me
And you can leave that old dog be
He does much better on his own
Leave him be
He‚Äôs a better man than me
He likes to find his own way home
On a drover‚Äôs road
With the moon and misty stars
We walked these hills
Before this all began
Before we gazed at screens
Went shopping in our cars
And a million houses
Sprawled across the land
Walk with me
And you can leave that old dog be
He does much better on his own
Leave him be
He‚Äôs a better man than me
He likes to find his own way homeI want my, I want my MTV

Maybe get a blister on your thumb

Quiet and gray against the still of the sky
They won't quit and lay down though the action has died
They watch the new game in town on the Blackwall side
From the poisonous drains a vision appears
New circle of cranes, a new reason to be here
A big silver dome rising up into the dawn
Above the church and the homes were all the silver is gone, gone, gone
If I'd a bucket of gold, what would I do?
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues
Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
A silver dawn steals over the docks
A truck with no wheels up on cinderblocks
Men with no dreams around a fire in a drum
Scrap metal schemes are rusted over and done, done, done
If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues
And I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
When you're standing on thin and dangerous ice
You can knock and walk in for Citizens' Advice
They'll tell you the where you can turn, the way you can go
There's nothing they can tell me I don't already know
If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues 
And I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
From the Canning Town train I saw a billboard high
There's a big silver plane rising up into the sky
And I can make out the words: "Seven flights every day"
Says six of those birds are bound for JFK
If I'd a bucket of gold, silver would do
I'd leave the story untold
Silvertown blues 
I said I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
I'm going down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Down in Silvertown
Songwriter:  Mark KnopflerIt wasn't just the music
It wasn't just the wine
Some other kind of magic
Was sending shivers up my spine
Then I was falling
And I fell for you, and how
Darling, are we in trouble now
They say we're grown up
But we've been searching all this time
I wouldn't own up
Never would admit to flying blind
But in the Darkness
We found each other anyhow
Darling, are we in trouble now
When we'd talk it over
Love was a cry from a distant shore
Then we found each other
And all that we'd been searching for
And I'm done denying
I guess by now you know
I'm through with trying
Can't bring myself to let you go
And all of these feelings
We said we never would allow
Darling, are we in trouble nowYour slack-jawed dimness is our loss
Condemns us to your point of view
Who could give a flying toss
What you like to chill out to?
And why should I lighten up for you
If you can‚Äôt heavy up for me?
Why should I? Why should I?
You grunt and root your patch of earth
Adrift from shame and deaf to sound
How much is your praise really worth?
About the same as your thumbs down
And why should I lighten up for you
If you can‚Äôt heavy up for me?
Why should I? Why should I?
So heavy up, heavy up for me
Heavy up, heavy up for me
You can give it up
Give it up with me
Or heavy up, heavy up for me
What would it take
To get you to shut it?
I‚Äôd so love it
And why should I lighten up for you
If you can‚Äôt heavy up for me?
Why should I? Why should I?
So heavy up, heavy up for me
Heavy up, heavy up for me
You can give it up
Give it up with me
Or heavy up, heavy up for me
You won‚Äôt of course, you will be heard
Ah, but at least a man can dream
I‚Äôm afraid, alas, the turd
Who thinks he‚Äôs an ice cream
And why should I lighten up for you
If you can‚Äôt heavy up for me?
Why should I? Why should I?
So heavy up, heavy up for me
Heavy up, heavy up for me
You can give it up
Give it up with me
Or heavy up, heavy up for me
Yeah, heavy up, heavy up for me
Heavy up, heavy up for me
You can give it up
Give it up with me
Or heavy up, heavy up for meI never thought I'd be the one
To be the raging bull
There'd always be a smoking gun
Who'd up and lose his cool
I never thought I'd have to say
I'm sorry, my love, because
I'm the fool I never
Fool I never thought I was
I left my dreams with broken strings
It's time I learnt to talk
Stop falling over things
Teach myself to walk
I'm not a superman
Or Mr. wonderful
Because I'm the fool I never
Fool I never thought I was
I'm the know it all
Trying to mend his broken heart
But I don't know how to call
And I don't know where to start
Now if you should lose your faith in me
I don't know where I'd run
I hope you'll always let me be
Your only one
Am I your one true love
Or am I too late for your applause
I'm the fool I never
Fool I never thought I was
Darling, I'm the fool I never
Fool I never thought I wasMy famous last words are laying around in tatters
Sounding absurd, whatever I try
But I love you, and that's all that really matters
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Your bright shining sun would light up the way before me
You were the one who made me feel I could fly
And I love you, whatever is waiting for me
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Who knows how long we've got
Or what we're made out of
Who knows if there's a plan or not
There is our love
I know there is our love
My famous last words could never tell the story
Spinning unheard in the dark of the sky
But I love you, and this our glory
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbyeSomebody's gotta crack a whip around here
Who's mindin' the store?
Shake it up, sell some beer
What's your money maker for?
Pay day we're packin' 'em in
Six gun Annie and buffalo Jill
But who's to say they'll be back again
For a refill?
Honey, you know the drill
Ain't no left turn down sleepy time street
You gotta be fast but you gotta stay loose
Thinkin' on your feet
Slick as grass through a goose
We gotta rationalise
The payroll is givin' me chills
You and me is gettin' organised
It's kill or be killed
Honey, you know the drill
Well they can all look down on sucker row
But they all forget
The tallest trees from acorns grow
Though they ain't yet
I never look down on a sucker stake
They all pay the bills
I never gave a sucker an even break
And I never will
A beautiful vision keeps comin' to me
I see a miracle mind
Flyin' in for free
Service with a smile
High rollers, fancy hotels
Big time singers toppin' the bill
You gotta have a feel for the stuff that sells
Call it a skill
Honey, you know the drill
Somebody's gotta crack a whip around here
Who's mindin' the store?
Shake it up, sell some beer
Money walkin' through the door
Annie's arrivin' at a dangerous age
Don't you go gettin' ill?
Get another woman up in the cage
Who ain't over the hill
Honey, you know the drill
Somebody's gotta crack a whip around hereThe barflies chatter
They don‚Äôt know any better
It doesn‚Äôt matter
You‚Äôre hanging on to a dream
To your own dream
They‚Äôre laughing and talking
One or two are clapping
But nobody‚Äôs walking
And you‚Äôre hanging on to a dream
To your own dream
Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn‚Äôt matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one day
Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn‚Äôt matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one day
A beer glass shatters
The bar staff clatters
It doesn‚Äôt matter
You‚Äôre hanging on to a dream
To your sweet dream
You don‚Äôt hurry, don‚Äôt worry
They‚Äôre going to know your story
It doesn‚Äôt matter
You‚Äôre hanging on to a dream
To your sweet dream
Let them do what they do
Say what they say
It doesn‚Äôt matter anyway
Every heart in the room
Will belong to you one dayMy darling girl
Oh! My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
My darling boy, my darling boy
All of my sunshine and all of my joy
You're all that matters, all that matters
Well, I can't stop the pain
When it calls, I'm a man
And I can't stop the rain
When it falls my darling, who can?
My darling girl
Oh! My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
Well, I can't stop the pain
When it calls, I'm a man
And I can't stop the rain
When it falls my darling, who can?
My darling girl
My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
My darling friend
My darling friend
All we've got going is love in the end
It's all that matters, all that matters
All that matters, all that mattersWell, all down the 40 I never used to lift
Thirteen gears, double clutch shift
All those horses underneath the hood
I don't do it no more but I used to could
GMC Cannonball going like a train
All down the 40 in the driving rain
All those horses underneath the hood
I don't do it no more but I used to could
Well I don't hang around 'cause it ain't no good
Like the big bad wolf in the neighborhood
Chasin' after Little Red Riding Hood
I don't do it no more but I used to couldIf I'm over the moon
It's because I'm over you
A day at a time
And I'm tickety boo
I don't carry on
The way I used to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo
If I'm doin' great
It's because when I get home
I don't go straight
To my answerphone
And the tears don't come
The way they used to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo
So many little things
So much better now
They were only the little things
Anyhow
If I'm over the moon
It's because that's what I am
Funny that once
I used to give a damn
And I'd do anything
In the whole wide world for you
Whoop dee doo
Whoop dee doo
Anything, anything you'd want me to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de dooThe drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air
Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into
That's what it is
It's what it is now
There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down
Lights are out in the city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep
And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
That's what it is
It's what it is now
The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone
And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul
And it's cold on the tollgate
With a Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
That's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now
There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours
On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick for my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell
That's what it is
It's what it is now
It's what it is
What it is now‚Ä¶The high priest of money looks down on the river
The dawn coming up on his kingdom of gold
When the rim of the sun sends an arrow of silver
He prays to the gods of the bought and the sold
He turns to his symbols, his ribbons of numbers
They circle and spin on their mystical scroll
He looks for a sign while the city still slumbers
And the ribbons and the river forever unroll
In his kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold
On the horizon an enemy haven
Sends traces of smoke high up into the sky
A pack of dog jackals and a rabble of ravens
Who'll come for his fortress, his castle on high
In his kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, his kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold
His axes and armour will conquer these devils
The turbulent raiders will falter and fall
Their leaders be taken, their camps burned and levelled
They'll hang in the wind from his citadel walls
In his kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold
Kingdom of gold, kingdom of gold
Kingdom of goldMiss you blues, baby, miss you blues
Miss you blues, baby, miss you blues
You never used to look behind you, that isn't what you'd do
Didn't leave a thing behind you but the miss you blues
Who's gonna take your place, fill your shoes?
Who's gonna take your place, fill your shoes?
You never used to look behind you, that isn't what you'd do
Didn't leave a thing behind you but the miss you blues
Miss you blues, baby, miss you blues
Miss you blues, baby, miss you blues
You never used to look behind you, that isn't what you'd do
Didn't leave a thing behind you but the miss you blues
Walk alone down the avenue
Walk alone down the avenue
You never used to look behind you, that isn't what you'd do
Didn't leave a thing behind you but the miss you blues
Miss you blues, baby, miss you blues
Miss you blues, baby, miss you blues
You never used to look behind you, that isn't what you'd do
Didn't leave a thing behind you but the miss you bluesBaby I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
That turn your blue skies into grey
Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now
Why worry now
Baby when I get down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
But baby just when this world seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way
Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now
Why worry nowIt‚Äôs the weight I‚Äôm trying
To get inside the frame
I‚Äôve been painting a fat man
He‚Äôs big and fat and heavy
As a man can be
But he‚Äôs been floating away, floating away
He‚Äôs been floating away from me
In the mirror my withering skin
Is a thorny pleasure
I stand unflinching
And I mark each crease and sting
My brush my wooden flail
My ancient thresher
As unforgiving time flays everything
It‚Äôs the truth I‚Äôm trying
To get inside the frame
Now I‚Äôm painting myself naked
But I need a pair of boots
About as heavy as boots can be
Or I‚Äôd be floating away, floating away
I‚Äôd be floating away from me
And every thorn sends thistledown
Drifting all around
And floating away, floating away
Floating away from meMy famous last words
Are laying around in tatters
Sounding absurd whatever I try
But I love you and that's all that really matters
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Your bright shining sun
Would light up the way before me
You were the one made me feel I could fly
And I love you whatever is waiting for me
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Who knows how long we've got
Or what were made out of
Who knows if there's a plan or not
There is our love
I know there is our love
My famous last words
Could never tell the story
Spinning unheard in the dark of the sky
But I love you and this is our glory
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbyeCamerado
See that cloud across the sun
Ain't too many places left to run
There was a time when we'd go anywhere the wind would blow
Camerado
Camerado
They are fencing off the plain
I hate to hear the whistle of the train
Next thing you know they'll want your pistol and your tobacco
Camerado
Got a piece of forty-four on fire in my chest
Out here on the mesa I will rest
If you could hand me down that whiskey from my saddle roll
Camerado
Now the light is dyin' in the sky
That ain't gonna bother you or I
Seen enough a dying to know almost all there is to know
Camerado
Now you had best light out and ride
There's pretty women on the other side
See ya in Sabinas you'll be free as air in Mexico
CameradoMiles between us, here we are
Side by side in a stranded car
Right now, baby right now
And it's too dark to see
Anyhow so where are we
Right now, baby, right now?
You could say we've both come down
To a place called lonesome town
When'd you loose a hold on me
Anyhow and where are we
Right now, baby right now?
We stood up and said 'I do'
Vowed to see each other through
Right now, baby right now
I'm looking down this road tonight
And I don't see a light
Right now, baby right now
If we're so clever tell me how
We're waiting for the wrecker now
Let's forget what used to be
Anyhow and where are we
Right now,oh baby right now?Here's a wishing well
Here's a penny for
Any tought it is
That makes you smile
Every diamond dream
Everything that brings
Love and happiness
To your life
Here's a rabbit's foot
Take it when you go
So you'll always know
You're safe from harm
Wear your ruby shoes
When you're far away
So you'll always stay
Home in your heart
You will always have a lucky star
That shines because of what you are
Even in the deepest dark
Because your aim is true
And if I could only have one wish
Darling, then I would be this
Love and happiness for you
Here's a spinning wheel
Use it once you've learned
There's a way to turn
The straw to gold
Here's a rosary
Count on every bead
With a prayer to keep
The hope you hold
You will always have a lucky star
That shines because of what you are
Even in the deepest dark
Because your aim is true
And if I could only have one wish
Darling, then it would be this
Love and happiness fot you
And if I could only have one wish
Darling, then it would be this
Love and happiness for youI'm better with my muscles
Than I am with my mouth
I worked the fairgrounds in the summer
And go pick fruit down south
And when I'm feel them chilly winds
Where the weather goes, I'll follow
Pack up my traveling things, go with the swallows
And I might get lucky now and then
You win some
I might get lucky now and then
You win some
I wake up every morning
Keep on eye on what I spent
Gotta think about eating
Gotta think about paying the rent
I always think it's funny
Gets me every time
The one about happiness and money
Tell it to the bread line
But you might get lucky now and then
You win some
You might get lucky now and then
Yeah, you win some
Now I'm rambling through this meadow, happy as a man can be
Think I just lay me down under this old tree
On and on we go through this old world a-shuffling
If you've got a truffle dog, you can go truffling
And you might get lucky now and then
You win some
You might get lucky now and then
You win someDonegan's gone, Lonnie Donegan

But I've been a fan of his for years
The way he sings and plays guitar
Still brings me to tears
I wouldn't want to be a big deal
I wouldn't want to be a celebrity
I spend my life building ships of steel
That's all there ever was for me
Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
And I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
He spends his life in the studio
Jet planes and big black cars
Plays records on the radio
In all of the clubs and in all of the bars
By day he didn't have a choice
You had to take a trade
You had no money and you had no voice
That's the life I made
Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
And I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
That's my claim to fame boys
That's my claim to fame
To sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
Well a song can live forever and a day
An old ship goes to the breakers yard
In a hundred years you're gonna hear him play
They won't remember me for working hard
Now they've all gone away, all the boys and the girls
They yard is a grave where the river runs through
We used to build the ships for the whole wide world
Now we couldn't do it if we wanted to
Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
That's my claim to fame boys
That's my claim to fame
To sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to famePeople say ‚ÄòWhere have you been?'
Or ‚ÄòWhere did you go?‚Äô
I'm a slow learner
I do everything slow
It's my way, has to be true
The world goes by me fast
But where you‚Äôre concerned
I like good things to last
Where's the point in worrying
If we should start a little late
Where's the point in hurrying
When waiting feels so great?
I'm a slow burner
My last train left a while ago
I'm a slow learner
I do everything slow
So where's the point in worrying
If we should start a little late
And where's the point in hurrying
When waiting feels so great?
I'm a slow burner
My last train left a while ago
I‚Äôm a slow learner
I do everything slow
Yeah, I‚Äôm a slow burner
My last train left a while ago
I'm a slow learner
I do everything slowMy lady may I have this dance
Forgive a knight who knows no shame
My lady may I have this dance
And lady may I have your name
You danced upon a soldier's arm
And I felt the blade of love so keen
And when you smiled you did me harm
And I was drawn to you, my Queen
Now these boots may take me where they will
Though they may never shine like his
There is no knight I would not kill
To have my lady's hand to kiss
Yes and they did take me through the hall
To leave me not one breath from you
And they fell silent one and all
And you could see my heart was true
Then I did lead you from the hall
And we did ride upon the hill
Away beyond the city wall
And sure you are my lady still
A night in summer long ago
The stars were falling from the sky
And still, my heart, I have to know
Why do you love me, lady, why?Are you home from the sea, my soul balladeer
You've been away roaming far away from here
Weathered a storm, your heart unafraid
Crossed every ocean in the boat that you made
Been blowing your horn, scaring the spooks
No crotchets or quavers in your books
Gone sailing all night, straight in the vein
Like a bird on his own flight in his domain
In the sky
In the sky
Running in on the tide with the first of the stars
The moon on the water and the sound of guitars
Glide into the homing as the night falls
Tie up in the haven by the old harbor wall
And the hard-bitten stranger, deaf as a post
Who stands at the fire where a poets dreams roast
He can't know the story, he can't feel the pain
And all of the glory falls around him like rain
In the sky
In the sky
You're a light in the dark, beacon of hope
And strong as a sea boat, strong as a rope
And the vagabond wind whispers over the bay
And the songs and the laughter are carried away
In the sky
In the sky
In the sky
In the skyIn summer sixty three I was staying alive
Hanging at the races, hoping to drive
When they were done with the weekend and loading the cars
I couldn't get a pass so I went to the bar
I'm up in the corner nursing a beer
Who should come laughing and joking in here
But Bobby Brown, the winner of the sports car race
With some friends and a girl, man, she lit up the place
Bobby was a wild boy, one summer
He knocked down a motel wall with a hammer
He'd do anything, one night for a bet
He raced through the cornfields in a Corvette
I thought it's got to be a thrill to be like that
With the beautiful girl and be king of the track
But the truth is when all was said and done
It was his Cobra I wanted, the car was the one
It was his Cobra I wanted, the car was the one
The car was the one
The car was the oneThe scaffolder's wife
Drivin' out of the yard
With a face that's as hard
As a scaffolder's bar
When she goes into town
She might take the top down
On the car
The quick little steps
In the stiletto boots
And the hair with the roots
She comes in as a rule
To get the nails done
And the tan for the sun
When the kids are in school
Don't begrudge her the Merc
Its been nothin' but work and a hard life
Losin' her looks over company books
The scaffolder's wife
In the wicked old days
When they went it alone
Kept the company goin'
On a wing and a prayer
They don't pay what they owe
When they have the cash flow
They don't care
Don't begrudge her the Merc
It's been nothin' but work and a hard life
Losin her looks over company books
The scaffolder's wife, the scaffolder's wifeWe've paid in hell since Moscow burned
As cossacks tear us piece by piece
Our dead are strewn a hundred leagues
Though death would be a sweet release
And our grande arm√©e is dressed in rags
A frozen starving beggar band
Like rats we steal each other's scraps
Fall to fighting hand to hand
Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with Bonaparte
What dreams he made for us to dream
Spanish skies, Egyptian sands
The world was ours, we marched upon
Our little Corporal's command
And I lost an eye at Austerlitz
The sabre slash yet gives me pain
My one true love awaits me still
The flower of the Aquitaine
Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with Bonaparte
I pray for her who prays for me
A safe return to my belle France
We prayed these wars would end all wars
In war we know is no romance
And I pray our child will never see
A little Corporal again
Point toward a foreign shore
Captivate the hearts of men
Save my soul from evil, Lord
And heal this soldier's heart
I'll trust in thee to keep me, Lord
I'm done with BonaparteMy mama and my daddy
Told me love is a two-way street
But lately baby, you've been finding
New ways of dragging your feet
So come on, take your best shot
You don't have to take the blame
I'll be your Belle Starr
You can be my Jesse James
There's lonely people everywhere
From Abilene to Arkansas
The way they run for cover
You'd think love was against the law
Well I don't need a pistol , baby
You won't have to rob a train
You can be my Belle Starr
And I can be your Jesse James
I know you've done some hard time
Baby, and you've got your doubts
When you feel surrounded
And it's looking like there's no way out
I'll come riding to rescue
All you gotta do is call my name
I'll be your Belle Starr
You can be my Jesse James
It don't take a genius, baby
There ain't no big mystery
You can't play it safe
And still go down in history
So saddle up the horses
'Cause we're headed for the hall of fame
I'll be your Belle Starr
You can be my Jesse James
I'll be your Belle Starr
You can be my Jesse JamesOn the road again in cabaret
Grey hair and Fenders
Old ghosts revisited today
No original members
Pick out a pretty one and toss your hair
Seems foolish when you‚Äôre older
You always felt you never had your share
A chip on both your shoulders
You‚Äôve been faking it so long
Now you don‚Äôt know right from wrong
Or what the future has in store for you
In the terminal of tribute to
Every day you take the bitter pill
The minibus driver says and you are who
You never made it and you never will
In the terminal of tribute to
Where your plans are forever falling through
And your dreams are movies never shot
And you‚Äôre someone, a shadow passing through
Nobody ever knew, so nobody forgot
Your bag has fallen from the carousel
They say one day it could come back to you
Exactly when nobody can tell
In the terminal of tribute to
 Before gas and tv
Before people had cars
We'd sit around the fires
Pass around our guitars
Remembering songs
When my daddy was home
He'd play along
On the spoons and a comb
We'd go with the flow
When the weather was fine
Sometimes we'd go
Collecting scrap iron
And we'd sit around the fires
Pass a bottle of wine
In the tales of the road
Since time out of mind
If heaven's like this
Well that's OK with me
Where the living is fine
And living is free
If heaven's like this
Well then here's where I'll be
On the edge of the field
On the edge of the world
Before gas and tvBeen kickin' sawdust
In these clothes
For a blue moon
And a red nose
The boys will put 'em up
And tear 'em down
We'll wash away
The dirt
Just a glass a day
Ain't gonna hurt
Pretty soon we'll move on
Out of town
We pass them by
Across the plains
We don't even try
To catch the names
It's supper-time and their kids
Are home from school
They draw the shades
On their shops
While we go a'checking
Through the props
And putting on the paint
To play the fool
Then we're rollin' on
Rollin' on
Feeling, better
Than we did last night
Rollin' on rollin' on
It's hard some times
Pretty much it's alright
I'll go soft shoe
When it rains
I'll go shuffle through
The aches and pains
Mr. young at heart
That's what I try to be
They all laugh
And cry
They get to feeling better
And that is why
If it was good for you
Truly it was good for me
Then we're rollin' on
Rollin' on
Feeling better
Than we did last night
Rollin' on rollin' on
It's hard sometimes
Pretty much it's alrightI never got the elbow
Just telling you
Before you go
Only telling you
Just so you know
I never got the elbow
I slung it in
Had it up to here
I just pulled the pin
Went and had a beer
I used to love a bit of folding
Just for getting by
A wad of cash
Now that's out of date
And so am I
As pie and mash
S‚Äôcuse me, s'cuse me
Have you got my roll?
My roll? My bacon roll?
The time they took us bowling
What was that about?
I thought what a joke
I just went out
And had a smoke
Then the white water rafting
Just some know-it-all
With the new regime
There to show us all
How to build a team
He says what do you think we're doing?
I said don‚Äôt ask me
I've no idea
They all laughed at that
That was pretty funny actually
S'cuse me, s'cuse me
Have you got my roll?
My roll? My bacon roll?
Have you got my roll?
My roll? My bacon roll?
I could order you a toastie
Just like that one there
Or the same in plain white bread
When you're dealing with a toastie
What do you prefer
Brown or red?
I never got the elbow
Just telling you
Before you go
Only telling you
Just so you knowOn your maypole green
See the winding morris men
Angry Alfie, Bill and Ken
Waving hankies, sticks and books
All the earthen roofs
Standing at the crease
The batsman takes a look around
The boys are fielding on home ground
The steeple sharp against the blue
When I think of you
Sam and Andy
Jack and John
Charlie, Martin
Jamie, Ron
Harry, Stephen
Will and Don
Matthew, Michael
On and on
We will remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Time has slipped away
The Summer sky to Autumn yields
A haze of smoke across the fields
Let's sup and fight another round
And walk the stublbed ground
When November brings
The poppies on Remembrance Day
When the vicar comes to say
Lest we forget our sonsPoverty stricken but still I'm a-stickin' to the things I know to be facts
One day it's feathers and the next day chicken while I'm pickin' my yakety axe
Ev'rybody says that I never will get far, keepin' out of work by pickin' this guitar
Livin' on a shoestring, puttin' off things like a shave and a haircut
Money don't matter as long as I scatter a little bit of happiness around
If people keep a grinnin' I figure I'm a winnin' my good old yakety sound
City folks go around turnin' up their noses and countin' their greenbacks and smellin' their roses
But I wouldn't trade my yakety axe, even for a T-bone
I'm confessin' I never took a lesson, all my notes are a matter of guessin'
Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound
So if you're in the mood and your feet start tappin'
And you feel laid back and your hands start clappin'
Then I'll have done what I wanted to from way back
You're diggin' my yakety axeIf I was staggerwing plane
A staggerwing painted red
I'd fly over to your house, baby
Buzz you in your bed
If I was a taperwing
A taperwing painted blue
I'd be barrell-rollin' over you
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
If I was a Maserati
A red  300 S
I'd ride around to your house, baby
Give you a driving test
If I was a Mustang racer
White with a stripe of blue
You could ride me, baby
Whenever you wanted to
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
If I was a Fender guitar
A Fender painted red
You could play me, darlin'
Until your fingers bled
If I was one of them Gibsons
Like a '58 or '9
You could plug me in
And play me anytime
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
If I was a motorcycle
A Vincent red Rapide
I'd ride around to your house, baby
Get you up to speed
If I was short track racer
I'd be an Indian
You could ride me around
And ride me round again
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider nowBlood and water bound to overflow
Blood and water bound to overflow
Well there's no more high water
But the Old Man's just waiting, I know
He was sent up on the levee
Now they've gone up country
They won't do nothing for you now
And don't go asking me
They've gone - it's all over here
Sometimes I'd see her passing
With the evening coming on
I've seen you on her pathway
I've seen you at dawn
Look over yonder at that empty shack
You know as well as I do
They ain't coming back
They're gone - it's all over here
Blood and water bound to overflow
Blood and water bound to overflow
Well there's no more high water
But the Old Man's just waiting, I know
So many promises
We broke them, every one
Kept people on the levees
With sherrifs and shotguns
They're gone - it's all over here
Look over yonder at that empty shack
You know as well as I do
They ain't coming back
They're gone - it's all over here
Blood and water bound to overflow
Blood and water bound to overflow
Well there's no more high water
No more high water
There's no more high water
But the Old Man's just waiting, I knowThis didn‚Äôt used to be me, old boy
This isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd want
Pulling old night fighters
In a restaurant
There‚Äôs smoke and flames behind me
Where the self-respect all went
And I‚Äôm behind, behind
With the rent
I‚Äôve been stitched up like a kipper, old son
But I won‚Äôt be again
Hell hath no fury
Oh, I‚Äôm like a lot of men
Now I‚Äôm stalking this old Doris
With lascivious intent
And I‚Äôm behind, behind
With the rent
Just a little duck and dive
And a bit of wheel and deal
She‚Äôll remind me I‚Äôm alive
She‚Äôll remind me I still feel
Just a little shelling out
For a bit of you-know-what
I know this is all about
Something that I never got
Well this crumpet‚Äôs past it‚Äôs sell-by-date
But they all would qualify
They‚Äôre going to be lonely
And be happy to comply
She knows that I‚Äôm a chancer
Coming on like a gent
But I‚Äôm behind, behind with the rent
Yes, I‚Äôm behind, behind with the rentThere'll be a change in the weather
And a change in the scene
How is that?
I'm gonna start wearin' leather
And change my routine
I'll wear dark glasses maybe a toupee
I'll get down and boogie and become risqu√©
I'll start wearin' make-up like Jackson and Prince
You'll see me ridin' in my Mercedes Benz
Nobody wants you when you just play guitar
There'll be some changes made tomorrow
There'll be some changes made
Y'know Chet, you're never gonna get
To play that rock and roll
Why is that?
You're kinda country, a little bit old?
That hurts
But your money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Well, them groupie girls
Ain't what they're cracked up to be
Well, not all of them anyway
Well, I'd really like to find out
For myself, don't you know
I've had a kind of quiet life
Down here on music row
Oh, I know
Well uh?
Like a man, what do you think?
Man, I don't know
I really think that I can make the grade
Daddy-o, Daddy-o
There'll be some changes made
I think I was sharp there
Just play one, just play
Yeah
You've played before
Watch it, watch it
Stand back boy
Well, I'd really like to find out for myself
Don't you know, 'cause
Like I said I've had a sheltered life
Down here on music row
I don't believe so
Well, what?
What do you think Mark?
I don't know
I really think that I can make the grade
There'll be some changes
Now listen to this
I'm gonna play some rock and roll
There'll be some changes made, yeah
There'll be some changes made
Now let's all play
Anybody hurt?
I learned this at summer Bible school
Well, I never could trust a saint
I'm only a part-time saint
Pretty good but you're no Mark Knopfler
What about that one there?
Not all that bad
I like that
I like that
Don't make me look bad now
Don't make me look bad
Respect for your elders
There'll be some changes madeI dug up a diamond
Rare and fine
I dug up, a diamond
In a deep, dark mine
If I only I could cling to
My beautiful find
I dug up a diamond
In a deep, dark mine
My gem is special
Beyond all worth
Strong as any metal
Or stone in the earth
Sharp as any razor
Or blade you can buy
Bright as an laser
Or any star in the sky
Maybe once in a lifetime
You hold one in your hand
Once in a lifetime
In this land
Where the journey ends
In a worthless claim
Time and again
In the mining game
I dug up a diamond
Rare and fine
I dug up, a diamond
In a deep dark mine
Down in the darkness
In the dirt and the grime
I dug up a diamond
In a deep, dark mineTonight we pushed the boat out just a little too far for comfort
Thought I'd get my order in
Seeing as you asked and seeing as we're talking
You never had a way with words
So it's something of a drag to hear you
Like a wind up bird
Telling all and sundry how come nothing's good
How you are misunderstood
You never had a lot upstairs
So it's something of a drag to see you
A legend in your own armchair
Telling all and sundry how things ought to be
What's wrong with the industry
And then it all comes back to you
You wanna know what you should do
Shut up and deal, let's see you do better
Shut up and deal, let's see you get it on
Shut up and deal, and put it all together
Let's see you do it all
You say well it's alright for him
I got more talent in my little finger
And what about that game she's in
How can she call herself a sinner or a saint
She knows how to play the game
I know what it's leading to
You want to know what you should do
Shut up and deal, let's see you do better
Shut up and deal, let's see you get it on
Shut up and deal, and put it all together
Let's see you do it allAnd how he used to thrill the crowd
The ready eye with bat and ball
The village fighter, heavy browed
The Englishman who had it all
A mighty shoulder to the wheel
To join in battle with the best
The iron arm, the will of steel
And heart of oak to mourn the rest
A power harnessed to the game
Once yoked and tempered fades away
The willing arm, the steady aim
The youth and fire that won the day
As twilight shadows dim the field
The ageing fighter stands bereft
With just the will to never yield
And heart of oak to mourn what‚Äôs leftI'm a maker of ballads right pretty
I write em right here in the street
You can buy them all over the city
Yours for a penny a sheet
I'm a word pecker out of the printers
Out of the dens of Gin Lane
I'll write up a scene on a counter
Confessions and sins in the main
Boys, confession and sins in the main
Then you'll find me in Madame Geneva's
Keepin' the demons at bay
There's nothin like gin for drownin' them in
But they'll always be back on a hangin' day
On a hangin' day
They come rattlin' over the cobbles
They sit on their coffins of black
Some are struck dumb, some gabble
Top-heavy on brandy or sack
The pews are all full of fine fellows
And the hawker has set up her shop
As they're turnin' 'em off at the gallows
She'll be sellin' right under the drop
Boys, sellin' right under the drop
Then you'll find me in Madame Geneva's
Keepin' the demons at bay
There's nothin' like gin for drownin' them in
But they'll always be back on a hangin' day
On a hangin' dayI didn't ask for much
As maybe I ought've
But I'm staying in touch
With the one I love
And I can see in the dials
And in these headlights beams
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with you
These are the big payloads
Hammer down on the floor
These are the restless roads
Every one a war
But in the flashing lines
I see a love supreme
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with you
They promised me some good home time
And some layover pay
The agent he's a friend of mine
Says it's due my way
I'd drive a thousand miles
Haul a trailer of tears
Just to see you smile
And as the dawn appears
At the edge of the night
There's still a light that gleams
Beyond my wildest
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
Beyond my wildest dreams
I've been with you
I've been with youIf I could see you just one time
Oh, how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh, I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh, I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh, I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time
Wish I could see you just one time
Wish I could see you just one timeNobody's got the gun
Nobody's trying to get the drop on anyone
Nobody's standing out on main street
With the sun blazing down
Saying "There's only room for one of us in this here town"
Nobody's got the be the number one
Nobody's got the gun
She may not understand
And she may want you eating from her hand
If she's got you in a corner
And you can smell the smoke and flame
You reach for your revolver
To do the same
You'll blow your love away forever, number one
Nobody's got the gun
You may think love is hard enough
You may never get to rehearse
And you can do without this stuff
Making everything worse
She's just the same as you
She needs your love just like you want her to
You can't go playing poker
With a pistol in your sleeve
You can't make somebody love you
By threatening to leave
If you want a love forever, number one
Nobody's got the gunWhen I gave my heart to a tinker boy
He said a fish could love a swallow
And I will go with my travelling man
Wherever he goes I will follow
He will mend your pots and pans
Your kitchen knives he‚Äôll take and sharpen
Then I‚Äôll be gone with my travelling man
And never more your doorway darken
The fish and the bird who fall in love
Will find no place to build a home in
The fish and the bird who fall in love
Are bound forever to go roaming
Bound forever to go roamingShe came on the river
With a gift for me
I'm in way deep
That's how it has to be
It's hot in the desert
But I'm cool in the zone
People call me lucky
But I say you make your own
I'm on a roll
Yeah, I'm on a roll
I'm runnin' hot
Baby, am I hot or what?
This is outrageous
I got all kinds of stuff
Can I dodge bullets
And can I bluff
Hot shots keep on a' coming
Looking for a fight
But the names are going down
To the left and to the right
And I'm on a roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a roll
I'm runnin' hot
Baby, am I hot or what?
It gets dark at night
That's how it goes
It gets cold in winter
Don't be surprised if it snows
You wanna play Hold'em
With my friend Mr Chan
If you lose your stack, well
You sure can't blame the man
Ha! ha! ha!
Ha! ha! ha!
I'm runnin' hot
Baby, am I hot or what?
They play with me a while
I'll read 'em like a book
Let's go have a drink or two
And talk about the scalps I took
I got a big old stack
I had me a big old day
Tomorrow I go back
Gonna take it all the way
'Cos I'm on a roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on a roll

I met a man, his name is Stan
He had a dog called Cory
Lost my dough in Pompano

I don't want no champagne fizz
I don't want no shandy
I don't want a goodnight kiss
It's just sugar candy
Don't lock me out
Don't leave me in the cold

Baby, I'll be good as gold
Believe me, I'll be good as gold*Instrumental*Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
Now where are you when the sun goes down
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
So far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
All right
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
'Cause you're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
All right
And I get so tired when I have to explain
When you're so far away from me
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me
Check it out
So far away
You're so far away from me
All right
Yes, you're so far away from meMe and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line
And a little southeast of Meridian
She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again."
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian
Now he's lyin somewhere
About a million miles from Meridian
She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is the great big world
Thats where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
One of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line
Just a little southeast of Meridian
Yeah she tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she learned to bend
One thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got 'em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end
At least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had five kids
Coulda been the whiskey
Coulda been the pills
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian
Who never got any further
Across the line than Meridian
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground...We're old enough for leaving home
The old Joanna and the old trombone
It's all going on, I'm growing my sideboards long
Hey, you and me can be who we want to be
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Calling it a teenage scene and I have a dream
Don't know if I'll be a star and I'm gonna play guitar
I've seen this rocking cat
I wanna be just like that
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Look at you baby
We can get wild, oh yeah
We'll be on our own
Billy Fury on a gramophone
Take you to the pictures and a dance
Me in my drainpipe pants
Check the mirror and the old DA
And you can play in a day
Listen now, right here
It's gonna be a beautiful year
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey, look at you baby
We can get wild
Hey, look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey, look at you baby
We can get wild
Hey, we can get wild
We can get wild
Get wildSunday mornin', here we are
The boys come home
Not quite the movie star
Hes been in Hollywood
The boys come home
The boys done good
He says she asked too high a price
Neglecting to declare
What sits between them there on ice
Chilled with the fizzy and the still
He tried but didn't make it there
It's not for me
It's not for me
He says she asked too high a price
Neglecting to declare
What sits between them there on ice
Chilled with the fizzy and the still
He tried but didn't make it there
It's not for me
Not for me
Sunday papers, here we are
The boys come home
The boys come homeYou can't fool a fooler
I can tell when a John got jazzed by a Jezebel
You can't beat the house
You can't beat the house
Tell the man somebody
You can't beat the house
When these horn dogs
Get lucky with dough
They'll blow it on the rooster
And the girls of Smokey Row
You can't beat the house
You can't beat the house
Now tell the man somebody
You can't beat the house
You want to buy you a dance
Don't buy it in here
It's all skin games and jelly roll
Red-eye and beer
They're all as mean as rat snakes
All got knives in their boots
Even the piano player, man
He don't care who he shoots
See that little home wrecker
In the backroom
She'll pick your pocket
With her pet raccoon
You can't beat the house
You can't beat the house
Tell the man, somebody
You can't beat the houseCome my love, I'll tell you a tale
Of a boy and girl and their love story
And how he loved her, oh, so much
And all the charms she did possess
Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex
How he worshiped the ground she walked
And when he looked in her eyes he became obsessed
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
It's as real as the feelings, I feel
This love was stronger than the powers so dark
A prince could have within his keeping
His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast but only sleeping
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
It's as real as the feelings, I feel
He said, "Don't you know, I love you, oh, so much
And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?"
She said, "Don't you know that storybook loves
Always have a happy ending?"
Then he swooped her up just like in the books
And on his stallion they rode away
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings, I feel
It's as real as the feelings, I feelA dirty motor with London plates

Vic and Ray, Vic and Ray
Come to daddy baby, what is it worth
Come to daddy, the scum of the crying earth
Vic and Ray, Vic and Ray
Vic and Ray, Vic and Ray
Laughing at each other's pain
They run the heater in the morning rain
This'll pay the rent around the world
Wanna buy a picture of a girl
Christmas morning, there they are
Two rent boys wishing on a shining star
Vic and Ray, Vic and Ray
Vic and Ray, Vic and RayDo I want you?
Yes I do
Do I need you?
Baby you know it's true
But I ain't got nothin' that you can use
So I'm sittin' on my own here with these poor boy blues
One day, baby, you will see
You're gonna give all your love to me
I'm the one, babe, that you're gonna choose
But in the meantime, I got these poor boy blues
Pick it son, pick it nice
Things won't always be the same
Someday soon, everything will change
You'll tell your mama her baby's got good news
But until then, well, I got these poor boy bluesNow if I was to sing for you
A song you never heard
And give it to you my finest treasure
Would you look at what I bring to you
Turn without a word
Leave me at your gate
Keep me waiting at your pleasure
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Maybe never
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Forever
Well I'll beat out a lion heart tattoo
Ill bring you pipes and drums
Ill bring you books of burnished leather
Ill set to sea in ships for you
Brave a thousand runs
Ride a hurricane
Laugh at any stormy weather
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Maybe never
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Forever
You set no store by gems and gold
You scorn my weather chart
You are not concerned with mens advances
I want you more a hundred-fold
When you lift my heart
Ill burn no other flame
Bear no one elses lances
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Maybe never
What have I
What have I got
What have I got to do
To win your love
Forever
To win your love
ForeverAfter two thousand came two thousand and one
To be the new champions, we were there for to run
From springtime in Arizona, 'til the fall in Monterey
And the raceways were the battlefields and we fought 'em all the way
It was in Phoenix in the morning, I had a wakeup call
She went around the without a warning and put me in the wall
I drove at Long Beach California with three cracked vertebrae
And we went on the Indianapolis, Indiana anyway
Well, the Brickyard's there to crucify anyone who will not learn
I climbed a mountain to qualify went flat through the turn
And I was down in the might-have-beens and an old pal good as died
And I sat down in gasoline alley and I cried
Well we were in at the killer camp on the Milwaukee mile
And in June up in Michigan we were robbed at Belle Isle
Then It was on to Portland Oregon for the G. I. Joe
And I blew off almost everyone when I my motor let go
New England, Ontario we died in the dirt
Those walls from Mid Ohio to Toronto they hurt
So we came to Rhode America where we burned up at the lake
But at the Speedway At Nazareth I made no more mistakes
