I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue BayouFeeling better now that we're through
Feeling better cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm turning you down baby and I'm going my way
Forget about you baby cause I'm leaving to stay
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
Oh, oh no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no goodSomewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight
Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come truePeople try to rape me
Always think I'm crazy
Make me burn the candle right down
Baby I can't stay
I don't need your jewels in my frown
Now all you women are low-down gamblers
Cheating like I don't know how
Baby I go crazy
There's fever in the funkhouse now
Well this low-down bitching
Got my poor feet a-itching
Can't you see the deuce is still wild
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice
Always in a hurry
Never stop to worry
Can't see the time passing by
Honey got no money
I'm sixes and sevens and nines
Well hey now baby I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice
I said my my my
I'm the lone crapshooter
Playing the field every night
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice
You got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Oh oh oh you got to roll me
Woo hoo hoo you got to roll me
Woah babe you got to roll me
Baby babe you got to roll meThey say that love's a gentle thing
But it's only brought me pain
For the only man I ever loved
Has gone on the morning train
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life
Well the train pulled out
The whistle blew
With a long and a lonesome moan
He's gone he's gone
Like the morning dew
And left me all alone
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life
Well there's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young man's heart
But never a change in mine
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my lifeI been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know
But I'm still willin'
Out on the road late last night
I'd see my pretty Alice in every headlight
Alice, Dallas Alice
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'
And I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stove in but I'm still on my feet
And I'm still willin'
And I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico
Ah but I'm still...
And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the backroads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites and wine
And you show me a sign
And I'll be willin' to be movin'Oh the pain of loving you
Oh the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
Oh the pain of loving you
Oh the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh the pain of loving you
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go
Oh the pain of loving you
Oh the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh the pain of loving you
Oh the pain of loving youThe hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my homeground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they growI've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?Written by Karla Bonoff

Oh we never know where life will take us
I know it's just a ride on the wheel
And we never know when death will shake us
And we wonder how it will feel
So goodbye my friend
I know I'll never see you again
But the time together through all the years
Will take away these tears
It's okay now
Goodbye my friend
I've seen a lot things that make me crazy
And I guess I held on to you
We could've run away and left well maybe
But it wasn't time and we both knew
So goodbye my friend
I know I'll never see you again
But the love you gave me through all the years
Will take away these tears
I'm okay now
Goodbye my friend
Life's so fragile and love's so pure
We can't hold on but we try
We watch how quickly it disappears
And we never know why
But I'm okay now
Goodbye my friend
You can go now
Goodbye my friendI wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's angels in heaven for to sing
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the skyLove is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
I wanna see what's never been seen
I wanna live that age old dream
C'mon boy, let's go together
Let's take the best, right now
Take the best right now
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
I wanna go to an old hoe-down
Long ago in the western town
Pick me up cause my feet are draggin
Gimme a lift and I'll paint your wagon
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
Love is a rose, but you'd better not pick it
Only grows when it's on the vine
Handful of thorns and you know you've missed it
Lose your love when you say the word mine
Mine
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a roseI don't want your lonely mansions
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the haloed moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mineIt's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love's for fools
Here I go breaking all the rules
It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Yeah, where you're concerned
My heart can learn, oh
It's so easy to fall in love

Look into your heart and see

It seems so easy

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in loveThose memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there and I am so lonesome
Without your love, I'd go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
Until the day they lay me down!Ay, que laureles tan verdes!
!Que rosas tan encendidas!
Si piensas abandonarme mejor quitame la vida;
Alza los ojos a verme
Si no estas comprometido
Eres mata de algodon
Que vives en el capullo;
Ay, que tristeza me da
Cuando te llenas de orgullo
De ver a mi corazon
Enredado con el tuyo!
Eres rosa de castilla
Que solo en mayo se ve
Quisiera hacerte un invite
Pero la verda no se
Si tiene quien te lo evite
Mejor me separare
Por "ai" va la despedida
Chinito por tus quereres
La perdicion de los hombres
Son las benditas mujeres;
Y aqui se acaban cantando
Los versos de los laurelesWell I lay my head on the railroad track
Waiting on the Double E
But the train don't run by here no more
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me
Well I met a man out in Hollywood
Now I ain't naming names
Well he really worked me over good
Just like Jesse James
Yes he really worked me over good
He was a credit to his gender
Put me through some changes Lord
Sort of like a Waring blender
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me
Well I met a boy in the Vieux Carres
Down in Yokohama
He picked me up and he threw me down
He said "Please don't hurt me Mama"
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor pitiful me
Oh these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful meDesperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone
And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're loosin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling
Goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too lateThere you go baby, and here am I
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Golly gee, what have you done to me?
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore
Do you remember baby, last September
How you held me tight, each and every night?
Oh baby, how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore
There is no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you
Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, till the end of time
And I'll find somebody new, and baby
We'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore
There is no use in me a-crying
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying
I've thrown away my nights
Wasted all my days, over you
Now you go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
Now and forever, till the end of time
And I'll find somebody new, and baby
We'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore
No you won't matter anymore
No you won't matter anymore
You won't matter anymoreSomewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight
Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true
And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky
Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come trueWell I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the Twentieth Century
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the Twentieth Century
I was lying in a burned-out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new homeToday I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And she looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and stood so close to you
Suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
It's hard to know another's lips have kissed you
And held you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I've missed you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with youPeople say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Oh I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another guy
Looking like I'm having fun
Although he might be cute he's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Woah baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Ooh ooh ooh oohOoh, la la la
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
I'm crying
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes, too
I'm crying
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope
'Cause I'll be here
Someday I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
Ooh, I'm crying
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh, baby baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hooOne day a mother went to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style
It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile
She left a smile you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those walls around you could never change her
You were her baby and e'er will be
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style
It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile
She did not bring to him a parole or pardon
She brought no silver, no pomp or style
It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile
The sweetest gift, a mother's smileLook at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know
Look at these eyes
They never seen what matters
Look at these
Dreams so beaten and so battered
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all I need to know
So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me, sometimes I see so clearly
That only truth I'll never know is me and you
Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be all there is to knowJust one look
And I fell so hard
In love
With you
Oh oh
I found out
How good it feels
To have
Your love
Oh oh
Say you will
Will be mine
Forever
And always
Oh oh
Just one look
And I knew
That you
Were my only one
Oh oh
I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong
Oh yeah yeah
Ah but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you
Make you my own
So you see
I really care
Without you
I'm nothin'
Oh oh
Just one look
And I know
I'll get you
Someday
Oh oh
Just one look
That's all it took, hey
Just one look
That's all it took, woah
Just one look
That's it was baby
You know I love you baby
I'll build my world around you
Come on babyI lose my way
No one cares
The words I say
No one hears
My life it seems is a world of dreams
Deep in the night
You'll find me
Dream and you're right behind me
Stay...if you will stay
We'll dream the night away
Dreams to dream
In the dark of the night
When the world goes wrong
I can still make it right
I can see so far in my dreams
I'll follow my dreams until they come true
There is a star
Waiting to guide us
Shining inside us
When we close our eyes
Come with me
You will see what I mean
There's a world inside
No one else ever sees
You will go so far in my dreams
Somewhere in my dreams
Your dreams will come true
Don't let go
If you stay close to me
In my dreams tonight
You will see what I see
Dreams to dream
As near as can be
Inside you and me
Will always come true
Inside you and me
That always come truePast three o'clock
And a cold frosty morning
Past three o'clock
Good morrow, masters all
Church bells are chiming
Ding dong, ding dong
One, two, three, four, five, six, sev'n, eight, nine, ten, 'leven
‘Til the midnight sun shines
Past three o'clock
And a cold frosty morning
Past three o'clock
Good morrow, masters allWhenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
Sometimes I stare into space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I hadn't ever felt like this before
Now that funny feeling has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh 
Ooh She tells him she thinks she wants to be free
He tells her he doesn't understand
She takes his hand
And tells him nothing's working out the way she planned
She's so many women
He can't find the one who was his friend
He's hanging on to half a heart
But he can't have the restless part
So he tells her to hasten down the wind
Now he agrees he thinks she ought to be free
Now she says she'd rather be with him
Oh it's just a whim
That she's designed to keep him out there on that limb
She's so many women
He can't find the one who was his friend
He hanging on to half a heart
But he can't have the restless part
So he tells her to hasten down the wind
He tells her to hasten down the wind
He tells her to hasten down the windAm I really here in your arms?
It's just like I dreamed it would be
I feel like we're frozen in time
And you're the only one I can see
*Chorus*
Hey, I've lived all my life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you
All my life
And I never really knew how to love
I just hope somehow I'd see
Oh I.. asked for a little help from above
Send that angel down to me
Hey, I've lived all my life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you
All my life
All my life
Never thought that I could feel a love so tender
Never thought I can let those feelings show
But now my heart is on my sleeve
And this love will never leave
I know
I know...
Ah..
Hey, I've lived all my life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I'll spend  all my life with you
All my life 
Hey, I've lived all my life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I'll spend all my life with you
*To Fade*I ride an old paint
I lead an old dam
I'm going to Montana
To throw a houlihan
They feed in the coolies
They water in the draw
Their tails are all matted
Their backs are all raw
Ride around
Ride around real slow
The fiery and the snuffy are raring to go
Old Bill Brown
Had a daughter and a son
One went to Denver
And the other went wrong
His wife she died in a poolroom fight
And still he keeps singing from morning til night
Ride around
Ride around real slow
Well the fiery and the snuffy are raring to go
Well when I die
Take my saddle from the wall
Put it on my pony
And lead him from his stall
Tie my bones to his back
Turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie
That we like the best
Ride around
Ride around real slow
Well the fiery and the snuffy are raring to go
Ride around
Ride around real slow
Well the fiery and the snuffy are raring to goTonight my bag is packed
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me 'cross the border
Tomorrow my love and I
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border
We'll leave behind, my dear
The pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Brazos muddy waters
Where the sky grows gray and wide
We'll meet on the other side
There across the border
For me, you'll build a house
High up on a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border
Sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms 'neath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border
Tonight we'll sing the songs
And I'll dream of you, my Corazon
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the Saints blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There across the border
For what are we
Without hope in our hearts?
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the borderTo know know know him is to love love love him
Just to see him smile makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him, I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day when I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see? How blind can he be?
Someday he will see that he was meant for me
To know know know him is to love love love him
Just to see him smile makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him is to love love love him
And I doThere's somebody waiting alone in the street
For someone to walk up and greet
Here you are all alone in the city
Where's the love that you took to your side?
Lonely faces will stare through your eyes in the night
And they'll say
Woman sweet woman, please come home with me
You're shining and willing and free
But your love is a common occurrence
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still you know that may be what I need
Is someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life
Someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life
The morning is breaking
The street lights are off
The sun will soon share all the cost
Of a world that can be sort of heartless
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still you know that may be all you'll get
Is someone to lay down beside you
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside you
You just can't ask for morePor un amor
Me desvelo y vivo apasionada;
Tengo on amor
Que en mi vida dejo para siempre amargo dolor
Pobre de mi
Esta vida mejor que se acabe
No es para mi...
Pobre de mi 
Pobre de mi 
Cuanto sufre mi pecho
Que late tan solo por ti
Por un amor
He llorado gotitas de sangre del corazon
Me has dejado con el alma herida
Sin compasionWell, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
That'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
That'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, you gave me all your loving and your turtle doving
All your hugs and kisses and your money, too
You know you love me, baby, still you tell me maybe
That somebody, well, I'll be through
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
That'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well, when Cupid shot his dart, he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I'll leave you
You kiss and hold me and you tell me boldly
Well, that some day, well, I'll be through
Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
That'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Oh, that'll be the day, ooh
That'll be the day, ooh
That'll be the day, ooh
That'll be the day when I dieI hear mariachi static on my radio
And the tubes they glow in the dark
And I'm there with you in Ensenada
And I'm here in Echo Park
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinking down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town
Well I pawned my Smith and Wesson
And I went to meet my man
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street
At the Pioneer Chicken stand
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinking down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town
Well I'm sittin' here playing solitaire
With my pearl handled deck
The county won't give me no more methadone
And they cut off your welfare check
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinking down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of town
Carmelita, hold me tighter
I think I'm sinking down
And I'm all strung out on heroin
On the outskirts of townGone is the romance that was so divine
'Tis broken and cannot be mended
You must go your way and I must go mine
But now that our love dreams have ended
What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do
What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do
What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to
When I'm alone with only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do
What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to
When I'm alone with only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I doThey say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies, telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should have seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should have locked up all my silver
Brought the key back to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies, telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who is no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies, telling me liesWhen I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to melt in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
I will give my heart to youYou tell me that I'm falling down
A drifter with no role
You tell me that I need a friend
To help me take control
Well let it be I'm not alone
I'm only lonely see
And you can't tell me where to go
Or what or who to be
I am exactly what I am
And not the way you'd like to see me be
I look outside long as I can
Then I close my eyes and watch my world unfold before me
I may not lead the simple life
I've no love of my own
If no one gives me all his heart
I'll manage with a loan
I'm very used to feeling sad
It doesn't make me cry
And yes I do know how to love
And what you say's a lie
I am exactly what I am
And not the way you'd like to see me be
I look outside long as I can
Then I close my eyes and watch my world unfold before me
You tell me that I'm falling down
A drifter with no role
You tell me that I need a friend
To help me take control
Well let it be I'm not alone
I'm only lonely see
And you can't tell me where to go
Or what or who to be
I am exactly what I am
And not the way you'd like to see me be
I look outside long as I can
Then I close my eyes and watch my world unfold before meLo siento mi vida
Yo sé que ya terminó
Corazones quebrados
Esperanza que se fué
Cuando brille la luna
Yo sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo
Ya ha llegado el triste pesar
Debemos siempre separarnos
La noche que te fuiste
Cambió mi pobre vida
Quedo mi alma triste
Pensando en mi dolor
Cuando brille la luna
Yo sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo
Ya ha llegado el triste pesar
Debemos siempre separarnos
I wait for the night to pass and turn to day
I can't make this feeling go away
'Cause I get so weak when the day is through
And I think of you
I'm gonna see it through
Lo siento mi vida
Yo sé que ya terminó
Corazones quebrados
Esperanza que se fué
Cuando brille la luna
Yo sé que no dormirás
Ni tú
Ni yo
Ya ha llegado el triste pesar
Debemos siempre separarnos
Siempre separarThere's a little rosewood casket
Resting on a marble stand
With a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand
Go and bring them to me, sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried, but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes
When I'm dead and in my casket
When I gently fall asleep
Fall asleep to wake in heaven
Dearest sister, do not weep
Take his letters and his locket
Place them gently on my heart
But this golden ring that he gave me
From my finger never part
There's a little rosewood casket
Resting on a marble stand
With a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's handMaybe he's right
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be
Nobody knows when the truth goes by
But everyone tells me that he's happy
Maybe he's gone and found some love
I want to see it for myself
Everyone says just to let him alone
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so
Why
Why
Maybe I'm right
Maybe he's wrong
And maybe what he's saying is the way it should be
Somebody tried to explain it to me
But they couldn't tell me if he's happy
And I just want to know if he's still happyIf I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go
But I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
Oh, will always love you
Bittersweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Goodbye
Please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you need
And I will always love you
Oh, will always love you
And I will always love you
Oh, will always love you
I will always love youWritten by Eric Kaz

Life isn't easy
Love never lasts
You just carry on
And keep moving fast
I pulled off the highway
And rolled into town
I'm just fancy free babe
And I travel 'round
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes down
Where can I run to
How have I sinned
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind
And my thoughts are filled with memories
They won't let me be
But if all the stars are shining bright
Well they would not let me see
It's so cold and the rain keeps blowing
It's tearing through the town
But I'm still fancy free darling
And I travel 'round
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes down
Oh where can I run to
How have I sinned
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind
Sometimes I'm up
Most times down
Oh where can I run to
Tell me how have I sinned
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind
Who can I turn to
Tell me where to begin
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the wind
When you cry like a rainstorm
And you howl like the windSave me
Free me from my heart this time
Well the train's gone down the track
And I'm, I'm left behind
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I love you and lose again
Well the heart calls and the mind obeys
Oh it knows better than me baby
And if I hold on for one more day
Oh maybe maybe he'll be true
But nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I love you and lose again
Nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I love you and lose again
Woah I love you and lose againWhat if I fall in love with you
Just like normal people do
Well maybe I'd kill you
Or maybe I'd be true
When I go down to get a job sometime
It seems people can read my mind
And make money disappear
While they're talking sweet and kind
Well in some ways I am like a child
You never seemed to know it
And if a kind word ever crossed your mind
You never tried to show it
Well in some ways I am like a child
You never seemed to know it
And if a kind word ever crossed your mind
You never tried to show it
When people don't know what you mean
They may laugh at you and call you green
They'll say your words are stupid
And your plans are only schemes
Truth is simple
But seldom ever seen
Let nothing come between
Simple man, simple dreamTempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves a home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Faithful 'til death, said our loving master
A few more days to labour and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
As we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and byTo the east the factories stand
Like fire-breathing dragons against the sky
And from their throats, a scarlet river
Burns itself into smoky lullabies
Over neon and fluorescent skies
Valerie, can you hear those engines drone?
I wanted to go to Mexico
But I'm stranded here alone
And once I knew a true love
It's been three years since he's gone
And if I could get that feeling back
I'd give up everything I own
Sixteen days since I left Corona
And I traveled to this carnival town near Alberndeel
And I rode the coaster there on the fairground
Twisted backbone of a beast that never heals
And I left some skin on fortune's wheel
Valerie, can you hear those engines drone?
I wanted to go to Mexico
But I'm stranded here alone
And once I knew a true love
It's been three years since he's gone
And if I could get that feeling back
I'd give up everything I own
Everything's in slow motion now
In this little border town
I've come so close from so far
Just to hide behind these windows here
From the world outside
I watch those cars and trucks raise trails of dust
Down the road as they pass by
Valerie, can you hear those engines drone?
I wanted to go to Mexico
But I'm stranded here alone
And once I knew a true love
It's been three years since he's gone
And if I could get that feeling back
I'd give up everything I own
Everything I own
Everything I ownYou think the love you never had might save you
But true love takes a little time
You can touch it with your fingers
And try to believe your eyes
Is it love or lies?
So you're keeping your distance
A little bit of room around you
But if he doesn't return your call on time
Oh, my, my
You just act like a fool on a holiday
There's nothing that you wouldn't try
You must be a prisoner in disguise
Well, this nightlife is my life
But there's no one else in it
And sometimes, those lonesome breezes blow
But it's no show, so you might as well go
If you think you could win it
Without losing and letting it show
The city is no place to hide in
Everybody knows your number
And you know that you could never be alone if you tried
You just run like a man with no reason to run
And no place to ever arrive
You must be a prisoner
Look just like a prisoner
Well, you must be a prisoner in disguiseWell I spent my whole lifetime
In a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions
On the slightest of notions
And the first easy loving I found
But soon all the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away
There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face
Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing awayI've had bad dreams too many times
To think that they don't mean much anymore
Fine times have gone and left my sad home
Friends who once cared just walk out my door
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again
And I've heard you talk, "she's crazy to stay"
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
If I could buy your love, I'd truly try, my friend
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees
Asking for you to come back, I'd be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
I'd give anything to see you again
Yes, I'd give anything to see you againYou say tomorrow you're going
That's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the teardrops
'Cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leaveI'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling blue
I know, you'd love me as long as you wanted
Then someday, leave me for somebody new
Worry, why should I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?
I'm crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Worry, why should I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?
I'm crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying
And I'm crazy for loving youIf you see a friend and he tries to say
A girl we once knew is losing her way
It's true
I may be blue
I've seen the best years of life go through
A man that I love
And another I need
Both men have helped make the sad life I lead
Sorrow lives here in my heart
It haunts me when I sleep
I can't keep the thought of you from my dreams
Everything seems to spin all around
But I can't see
Whether it happens with or without me
Remember how perfume, my gown and silk gloves
Had teased your heart so and brought out your love
It's done
Night's breeze has blown
A chill up my spine
The world was mine
Then haughty and high
To bide my time
'Til all of my hopes
Just wish you were mine
Sorrow lives here in my heart
It haunts me when I sleep
I can't keep the thought of you from my dreams
Everything seems to spin all around
But I can't see
Whether it happens with or without meAt the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness, to hide our wrong, you and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me
I know that time is gonna take it's toll
We gonna pay for the love we stole
Ah, it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah, but our love keeps coming on strong, you and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
Just you and me
If you take a walk downtown
And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by
Oh, darling please don't cry, tonight we'll meet
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me, oh you and me
Oh, God, you and meWhere have you gone, my darling one?
Are you on your own?
Are you having fun?
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad?
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had?
Does a day go by like a memory?
Do you ever try to remember me
In an automobile or a crowded bar?
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are
And if you are still within the sound of voice
Over some radio, I just want you to know
You were always my only choice
And where ever you go then I still love you so
If you're still within the sound of my voice
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head?
Was it really me talking to your heart instead?
And if you are still within the sound of my voice
Watching this video, I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near, there's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress
But only you can send a lifeline out to me
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know
If it's wrong then I have no choice
But to love you until I no longer have a will
Are you still within the sound of my voice
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and diesWritten by Jimmy Webb

Deep down inside
I know I still love him
But he'll never know
Cause I'll never tell
I'll confide that I'm thinking of him
And wishing him well
I can't walk up to him and say to him
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
Lately I've seen
That look in his eyes
That just breaks my heart
He needs me so
To lean on at this moment
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hid
Maybe someday I'll throw off my foolish pride
This ain't so good
Watching him die this way
Cause he's the same guy inside
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say
Baby, what you been doing
I still love you like I did
You know, nothing's really changed here
But being the way I am
I keep it hidWritten by Jimmy Webb

Ran away from home when I was seventeen
To be with you
On the California coast
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
Out on the California coast
Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose
Adios
Adios
We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adios adios
Going up north where the hills are winter green
I have to leave you
On the California coast
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than the California coast
Our dreams of endless summer
Were just too grandiose
Adios
Adios
And I miss the blood red sunset
But I miss you the most
Adios adios
Adios
Adios
Adios adiosIf you've ever been taken for money
If you've ever gone down with your pride
If you've ever stood up for a good friend and lost
You know that the river is wide
Like a painter who waits for the sunrise
With a picture in both of his hands
It's like part of your life is already begun
With something that you don't understand
But don't cry now
Oh don't cry now
Don't cry now
No don't cry now
When you're lying alone in the night time
And your loneliness turns into fear
With the words of your memory failing and falling
You're drowning in a river of tears
But don't cry now
Ooh don't cry now
If you've ever thought much about freedom
You might find yourself caught in some door
With somebody you love more than 
And you've been weeping but you don't know what for
But don't cry now
Oh don't cry now
Don't cry now
Ooh don't cry now
Don't cry now
Woah don't cry nowThe strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three-day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him?
Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldier's life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him
He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me 'neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard, too fast
He falls asleep, his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him
They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France, the dead are everywhere
They die so fast, there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory, old world fame
The old world's gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him, but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them?
Lux aeterna Luce-at e-is
Domine cum sanctis tu-is in aeternum
Qui-a pius es
Requiem aeternaum dona e-is Domine
Qui-a pius es
Requiem aeternaum dona e-is Domine
Qui-a pius es
Et lux perpetua luce-at- e-is
Cum sanctis tu-is in aeternum
Qui-a pius es
Tonight the war is overWell I am just a vagabond
A drifter on the run
And eloquent profanity
It rolls right off my tongue
And I have dined in palaces
Drunk wine with kings and queens
And darling on darling
You're the best thing I ever seen
Won't you roll me easy
So slow and easy
Take my independence
With no apprehension no tension
Walk in, talk in paradise
Sweet paradise
Well I been around this country
From Denver to the oceans
And I never met girls that could sing so sweet
Like the angels that live in Houston
Singing roll me easy
So slow and easy
Play your concertina be a temptress
Darling I'm defenseless
Sing in harmony, in unison
Sweet harmony
Gotta hoist the flag and I'll beat your drum
Sing in harmony, in unison
Sweet harmony
Gotta hoist the flag and I'll beat your drum
Woah roll me easy
So slow and easy
Take my independence
With no apprehension no tension
Walk in, talk in paradise
Sweet paradiseWritten by Jimmy Webb

Shattered
Like a windowpane
Broken by a stone
Each tiny piece of me lies alone
And scattered
Far beyond repair
All my shiny dreams
Just lying there
I'm broken, but I'm laughing
It's the sound of falling glass
I hope that you won't mind if I should cry
In public, while I wait for this to pass
'Cause sweet darling I'm shattered
Into fragments cold and gray
Sweep the pieces all away
Then no one will ever know how much it mattered
Something deep inside of me
ShatteredLo, how a rose e'er blooming from tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse's lineage coming, as men of old have sung
It came, a floweret bright, amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night
Isaiah 'twas foretold it, the rose I have in mind;
With Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind
To show God's love aright, she bore to men a Savior
When half spent was the nightI've been higher than the high Sierra
Lower than Death Valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me
The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains?
I've been higher than the high Sierra
Lower than Death Valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me
I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me
I've been higher than the high Sierra
Lower than Death Valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about meWritten by Paul Carrack, Nick Lowe, Martin Belmont, J E Ceiling, J Eller

I was walking down the street
With a lot of not much to do
Wondering only if it was gonna rain
When this guy came into view
For a moment I looked crazy
And at first I couldn't work out why
Then something made me turn back the hands of time
To a careless past goodbye
Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
You're so wrong
So tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good
When he walked up
Me I stood there
With this picture in my mind
It was a flash like an old photograph
I keep with me all the time
Fished for silver in my pocket
Then I ran for the telephone
I dialed the number of all the reasons
Why you should button up and come on home
Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
You're so wrong
You're so tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good
Say you will change your mind
Don't be cruel
I'll be kind
You're so right
We're so wrong
You're so tough
So right
So wrong
You're so good
So right
So wrong
We're so tough
And so strongIt's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish, and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away onThey say just once in life
You find someone that's right
But the world looks so confused
I can't tell false from true
And love's so hard to find
In this state of mind
Oh I hope I'll know him
I hope I'll know him
If he's ever near
Well it seemed the time had come
I thought you were the one
When I looked into your eyes
It never looked like lies
And love's so hard to see
When it's in front of me
Oh I hope I'll know it
I hope I'll know it
If it's ever near
And love's so hard to see
When it's in front of me
Oh I hope I'll know it
I hope I'll know it
If it's ever near
Well I know that in my time
I'll have it sweet and fine
But it won't add up to much
Unless I feel his touch
And love's so hard to find
So I guess I'll just give up trying
Oh I hope I'll know him
I hope I'll know him
If he's ever nearOh sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Oh do I ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me? Do you, darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me?
Tell me, darling
Oh do I ever cross your mind?
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all?
Or do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die?
There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living?
Or can we continue to roam?
Will there be any freight trains in heaven?
Any boxcars in which we might hide?
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen?
Will they tell us that we cannot ride?
Will the hobo chum with the rich man?
Will we always have money to spare?
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there?
Will there be any freight trains in heaven?
Any boxcars in which we might hide?
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen?
Will they tell us that we cannot ride?
Will the hobo chum with the rich man?
Will we always have money to spare?
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there?Awake were they only
Those shepherds so lonely
On guard in that silence profound
When color had faded
When nighttime had shaded
Their senses from sight and from sound
Lo, then broke a wonder
Then drifted asunder
The veils from the splendor of God
When light from the Holy
Came down to the lowly
And heav'n to the earth that they trod
Lo, then broke a wonder
Then drifted asunder
The veils from the splendor of God
When light from the Holy
Came down to the lowly
And heav'n to the earth that they trod
May light now enfold us
O Lord, for behold us
Like shepherds from tumult withdrawn
Nor hearing, nor seeing
All other care fleeing
We wait the ineffable dawn
O Spirit all-knowing
Thou source overflowing
O move in the darkness around
That sight may be in us
True hearing to win us
Glad tidings where Christ may be found
O Spirit all-knowing
Thou source overflowing
O move in the darkness around
That sight may be in us
True hearing to win us
Glad tidings where Christ may be foundIt hurts to say goodbye
And when the words are going by
The wind can blow them right back in your eye
You can almost see it
Time will let you know
And when you turn around to go
The aching in your heart begins to show
You can almost see it
You can almost see it
You can almost see it
You can almost see it going by
So you take another train
But the tracks all look the same
They run around in circles like a game
You can almost see it
I can almost see it
I can almost see it
I can almost see it going byOh have you seen my dear companion?
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion?
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion?
Oh have you seen my dear companion?
Oh have you seen my dear companion?
For he was all this world to meHey Colorado
It was not so long ago
I left your mountains to try life on the road
But I'm tired of that race
It was much too fast a pace
And I think I've found my place
Colorado, I want to come home
I had a man there but I left him far behind
I could have loved him if I'd only had the time
Ah but I stopped along my way
Just long enough to say
That I'd really like to stay
But my baby
You know I have to go
I was too young
To know what I'd done
I made my plans
But I was wrong
Yes I was wrong
Colorado
Is it too late to change my mind
I've done some thinking
And I'm trying hard to find
A way to come back home
Cause I've been so very long alone
Won't you take care of your own
Colorado
I think I'm coming home
I want to come home
Let me come homeThough the miles are between us
I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote
Was on a blue piece of paper
That old feeling's back
The clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
Seems I have no friend
I feel the blues moving in
Oh, it's not the words you wrote
That made me sad and broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
'Tween the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll close for now, old friend
The last letter that you wrote
Was on a blue piece of paper
That old feeling's back
The clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
Seems I have no friend
I feel the blues moving in
My state of mind is desperate
And this hole that I'm sinking in
Gets deeper while I'm digging to get out
Oh, please give the right answer
To the questions I'm asking
Tell me you still love me
That would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote
Was on a blue piece of paper
That old feeling's back
The clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
Seems I have no friend
I feel the blues moving in
I feel the blues moving in
I feel the blues moving inLies, Lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, Lies
Are gonna make you sad some day
Tear, tears
I've shed a million tears for you
Tear, tears
And now you're loving someone new
Someday I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know when just now
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
You think that you're such a smart boy
And I'll believe what you say
Who do you think you are boy
To lead me on this way Hey
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
Are gonna make you sad some day
Someday I'm gonna be lonely
And you won't find me around
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
Someday I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know where or when
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
You think that you're such a smart boy
And I'll believe what you say
Who do you think you are boy
To lead me on this way Hey Hey Hey
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
Are gonna make you sad some day
Someday I'm gonna be lonely
But you won't find me around
Lies, lies
You're breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You're breaking my heartI love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heartLove, it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love, you don't see the pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share, but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff, easy enough
And if you choose, I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enoughLove will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side
And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time
Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near
And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's going to hurt me
For a long, long time
Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause
Living in the memory
Of a love that never was
Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm going to miss you
For a long, long time
And I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long timeBy the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he went
When he remembered Zion
For the wicked carry us away
Captivity require from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land
So let the words of our mouth
And the meditations of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight
Over IWritten by Karla Bonoff

Well I wake up in the night now
And don't you know I think of you
It's the fire in your eyes
That keeps on cutting through
There's nowhere I can run to
Can't seem to lose the thought of you
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Well I used to walk the straight line
I knew what I was doing all the time
There was nothing left to move me
I always held my ground
But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
I still remember how it felt when you put your arms around me
But if I thought you could love me, I was blind
But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Well you'd think I would've learned by now
And I'd keep away from you somehow
Just like a little child
I keep coming back for more
But baby when you come today
Don't you know that I'll come out and play
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again
Woah I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble againWhenever you find a man
That loves every woman he sees
There's always some kind of woman
That's putting him up a tree
Well that kind of man he ain't got
As much sense as a mule
You know everyone don't love you
They're just playing you for a fool
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
Now if you marry the wrong kind of woman
And you get where you can't agree
Well you just as well forget your plan
Let that woman be
But a man ought to make a good husband
And quit trying to lead a fast life
Going about dressing up other women
Won't put clothes on his own wife
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
Well there's lots of good women want to marry
And they want to live well at home
But they're 'fraid they'll get hold of some rowdy man
Can't let other women alone
And there's lots of good men want to marry
And they want to live well at home
But every time they turn their back there's a man there
Asking darling is he gone
Oh no it's not hard for you to understand
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you can
True love can be such a sweet harmony
If you do the best that you canAnd so you have come back to me
And say the old loves growing yet
You've tried through all these weary years
You've tried too vainly to forget
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The loving heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Come close and let me see your face
Your raven hair is tinged with snow
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face
I loved so many years ago
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The loving heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Farewell, I think I love you yet
As friend to friend, God bless you dear
And guide you through these weary years
To where the skies are always clears
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives us back our youth
The loving heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend, in perfect truthLove me tender
Love me true
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me long
Tell me you are mine
For it's there that I belong
Till the end of time
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always willIt might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down
Don't get upset, I am not pleading
Or saying I can't forget you
Well it don't even matter who you awaken with tomorrow
Cause baby you've been on my mind
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
Oh you know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'll just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind
It might be the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
Cause baby you've been on my mind
Baby you've been on my mind
Baby you've been on my mindMany rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My baby left me and he didn't say why
Well I guess I'll have to try
Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There have been times I find myself thinking of committing
Some dreadful crime
I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along white cliffs of DoverHey mister that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one singing this sad song
And I cry every time that you slip in one more dime
And play me singing the sad one one more time
Southern California
That's as blue as a girl can be
Blue as the deep blue sea
Won't you listen to me now
I need your golden gated cities
Like a hole in my head
Just like a hole in my head
I'm free
Hey mister that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one singing this sad song
And I cry every time that you slip in one more dime
And play me singing the sad one one more time
Do believe
I'll go back home
Hey, mister can't you see that I'm dry as a bone
I think I'll spend some time alone
Unless you find a way of squeezing water from a stone
We'll let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can
Let the springtime begin
Let the boy become a man
I have wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song
I have been this lonesome picker just a little too long
Hey, mister that's me up on the jukebox
I'm the one singing this sad song
And I cry every time that you slip in one more dime
And play me singing the sad one one more time
Well, I've been spreading myself thin these daysXicochi

Alleluia, AlleluiaWhen you went away I cried
Cried for so long
And I wanted you to stay
Ah but that was all wrong
The pain you left behind
Has become part of me
And it's burned out a hole
Where my love used to be
But it's not losing you
That's got me down so low
I just can't find another man
To take your place
Well you know I love you
But that wasn't enough
We both fell apart
When things got too tough
And I've learned how to give now
But what good
But what good would that do
No one can touch me
The way you used to do
And it's not losing you
That's got me down so low
I just can't find another man
To take your place
Well I know your opinion
Of me is not good
Please try to understand
That I'd change
Well I'd change if I could
And this coldness inside me
Well it's starting to build
And a woman can't be a woman
Unless she's fulfilled
But it's not losing you
That's got me down so low
I just can't find another man
To take your place
There's no one canTrouble, we have known trouble
In our struggle just to get by
Many times the burden's been heavy
Still we carried on side by side
And when we're gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When we're gone, long gone
And when we're walking together in glory
Hand in hand through eternity
It's the love that will be remembered
Not wealth, not poverty
And when we're gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When we're gone, long goneWritten by Paul Carrack, Nick Lowe, Martin Belmont

Don't need a roller or a limousine
Don't need my picture in a magazine
Don't need approval of a chosen few
Tell you what I do need
I need you
Don't need no fixtures fittings or phone
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own
I don't need reminding when the rent is due
I tell you what I do need
I need you
I need you like a flier needs a plane
Oh I need you like a ball needs a game
I need you like a pool needs a cue
Need you, need you, need you
I need you
I don't need no cupboard kisses for company
Don't want no washed up dishes soft soaping me
I don't need no other fella, honey I refuse
Tell you what I do need
I need you
Oh I need you like a flier needs a plane
Oh I need you like a ball needs a game
I need you like a shot needs to shoot
Need you, need you, need you
I need you

And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Oh Israel
To Thee shall come Emmanuel
O come , thou dayspring, bright and cheer
Our spirits by thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

And order all things far and nigh
To us the path of knowledge show
And cause us in her ways to go

All peoples in one heart and mind;
Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease

The monkey thought that everything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now listen, Jack"
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in jivin'
What's the use in divin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
The buzzard told the monkey you're chokin' me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye
And said your story's touching but it sounds like a lie
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and do right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and do right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Fly rightHow glad the many millions
Of Toms and Dicks and Williams
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell
And it was swell
You're my big and brave
And handsome Romeo
How I won you
I will never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime
Hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
Cause I've got a crush
My baby, on you
Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
Cause I have got a crush
My baby, on youLove I am told is the deepest mystery
Harder to fathom than any sea
More precious than all the earth and sky
But nobody can tell you why
Give one heart
Get back two
That's the paradox of I love you
So when you give your heart
You get one too
That's the paradox of I love you
If it is love for which you've cried
You know how it feels on moon's dark side
If your baby love's you right
You can have skyrockets any old night
Give one heart
Get back two
That's the paradox of I love you
So when you give your heart
You get one too
That's the paradox of I love you
And you can't stop saying it
I love you
Can't stop saying it
I love you
Keep on saying it saying it
I won't stop until you say it too
Love can be gentle soft and tame
Or so rough you wouldn't know its name
Shy and wild like a runaway child
Storms of love always end up mild
Give one heart
Get back two
That's the paradox of I love you
So when you give your heart
You get one too
That's the paradox of I love you
Give your heart
Get back two
That's the paradox of I love you
So when you give your heart
Get one too
That's the paradox of I love youSomething in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lost myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark, there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belongPor un amor
Me desvelo y vivo apasionada;
Tengo on amor
Que en mi vida dejo para siempre amargo dolor
Pobre de mi
Esta vida mejor que se acabe
No es para mi...
Pobre de mi 
Pobre de mi (no sufras mas...
Cuanto sufre mi pecho
Que late tan solo por ti
Por un amor
He llorado gotitas de sangre del corazon
Me has dejado con el alma herida
Sin compasion...
