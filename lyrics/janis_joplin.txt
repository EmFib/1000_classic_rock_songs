Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no
Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me
Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah
Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man
I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on
And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord
La da la la la, la da la la la la la
Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeahOh, come on, come on, come on, come on
Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man? Yeah
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did
And, and each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna, gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed
You're out on the streets looking good
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it

Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel goodI'd like to do a song
Of great social and political import
It goes like this
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
Spoken:
That's it!  Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

Honey I know she told you that she loved you

You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only got to do one thing well
You only got to do one thing well to make it in this world, babe

There's a fire inside of everyone of us
You better need it now, I get to hold it, yeah

Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no
And it never ever will, hey
I want to talk about a little bit of loving, yeah

I'm going to need it now
I'm going to use it, say, aah

And you're going to love your life
Or babe, someday you're going to have to cry
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed

I said everywhere, every day, every day
And every way, every way
Ah honey won't you hold on to what's going to move

You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honeyA woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting
She'll do crazy things, yeah, on lonely occasions
A simple conversation for the new men now and again
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head
And when she gets lonely, she's thinking about her man
She knows he's taking her for granted, yeah yeah
Honey, she doesn't understand, no, no, no, no!
Well, the fevers of the night, they burn an unloved woman
Yeah, those red-hot flames try to push old love aside
A woman left lonely, she's the victim of her man, yes she is
When he can't keep up his own way, good Lord
She's got to do the best that she can, yeah
A woman left lonely, Lord, that lonely girl
Lord, Lord, Lord!In this world, if you read the papers, Lord
You know everybody's fighting on with each other

"Honey, you can do anything
Every little thing, and I think I can
Oh, but what good, what good
Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring
Because I can't find you with my love
And I can't find you babe, oh anywhereHoward Smith: We were supposed to do an interview, do you remember, you know, a long time ago. And some article putting you down in Rolling Stone had just come out.
Janis Joplin: Yeah
Howard Smith: And you got very upset about that. Are you still that upset when you are put down in any articles?
Janis Joplin: You know I should be able to get past that, you know. But I mean girls want to be reassured. Which is not to say that all people don’t. But I think women especially … I mean even though I know that those are just a**holes that don’t know what they’re talking about and I should just continue with my music, you know. And let them either come into the show and listen, or go home and beat off. I don’t care what they do. I should be able to beat through that. But in my insides, it really hurts if someone doesn’t like me. You know, it’s silly. 
Howard Smith: Because I remember that time you were very upset.
Janis Joplin: Well that was a pretty heavy time for me. It was really important, you know, whether people were going to accept me or not.
Howard Smith: A lot of women have been saying that the whole field of rock music is nothing more than just a big, male, chauvinist rip-off. How do you..
Janis Joplin:  Yeah?
Howard Smith: Yeah. And when I say: “well what about Janis Joplin, she made it?” And they say: “oh, her.” And it seems to bother a lot of women’s lib people that you’re kind of so upfront sexually.
Janis Joplin: Well then that’s their problem. Not mine. I haven’t ever hardly talked with anyone in women’s lib. I haven’t been attacked by anyone yet. How can they attack me? I’m representing everything they said they want. You know what i mean? Well I have an opinion about this. It’s sort of like: you are what you settle for. Do you know what I mean? You’re only as much as you settle for. If they settle for being somebody’s dishwasher that’s their own f***ing problem. If you don’t settle for that and you keep fighting it, you know, you’ll end up anything you want to be. How can they attack me? I’m just doing what I wanted to and what feels right and not settling for bulls*** and it worked. How can they be mad at that?
Howard Smith: One girl I know said: well how come she doesn’t have any women in any of her groups?
Janis Joplin:  You show me a good drummer and I’ll hire one. Show me a good chick… Besides I don’t want any chicks on the road with me.
Howard Smith: You don’t?
Janis Joplin: I’ve got enough competition, man.  No, I like to be around men. 
Janis Joplin: Did all that s*** I said about chicks sound bad?
Howard Smith: No, you said what you wanted to say. Don’t be silly.
Janis Joplin: Well I don’t want to offend people. It’s just that like, you know, I have a certain set of circumstances I live under. Like you know all this repressive upbringing and things. I had that, too. You don’t think I had a repressive upbringing in Port Arthur, Texas? It’s just that it drove me crazy and I kept fighting against it. I don’t think you can talk anybody into fighting against it. If they don’t have it in themselves to need more. You know what I mean? Just plain need more. Then that’s that. If they do need more, they’ll get more. They’ll demand more. You know what i mean?
Howard Smith: Okay. thanks a lot.
Janis Joplin: Sure enough.
Howard Smith: Okay. Goodbye.
Janis Joplin: ByeBye, bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
I may be seeing you around
When I change my living standard and I move uptown
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
So long, my honey, so long
Too bad you had to drift away
'Cause I could use some company
Right here on this road, on this road I'm on today
I get the feeling, I could chase you clean on in the ball
And wind up staying pull off, put down strung out and stalled
Honey, I ain't got time to wait on you or to fetch your super ball
I got lots of things I've got to do
I know that you got things to do and places to be
I guess I'll have to find the thing you placed on me
I may wind up in the street or sleep beneath a tree
Still I guess you know honey, I've gotta go
Bye, bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
I guess you know you're on your own
It seems you just got lost somewhere out in the world
And you left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
Bye, bye, baby, baby, bye, byeLive your loving life
Live it all the best you can
And if you pay no attention darling
To what you might ever hear from your man

And my dreams are beyond my control
Oh yes, they are
But when that steamboat whistle blows
Oh, honey I'm gonna give you everything I ever had to give, yeah
And I do hope that you can receive it well
I know that it must be dependin' on the way you feel that you live
Whoa, landlord, please heed these words that I try to speak
I know you must have suffered much
But honey you ain't alone, you ain't so unique
No no no, no no
All of us at times, I said, we might have worked too hard
Or too heavy, too fast and way too rushed, yeah
But everyone can fill their life with anything
You can look around, but baby, you just cannot touch
Whoa, my dear landlord, please don't you dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue with you
And honey I'll tell ya, I'm ain't gonna move to no other place
'Cause I just ain't gonna do it, no no no
Each of us must have our own special gift
Oh honey, don't you know that it's got to be true
And if you don't underestimate me, I'll tell you one thing
I said that I won't underestimate you, noSummertime, time, time
Child, the living's easy
Fish are jumping out

CryDown on me, down on me
Looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me
Love in this world is so hard to find
When you have got yours and I got mine
That is why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me
When you see a hand that's held out toward you
Give it some love, some day it may be you
That is why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They are down on me, yeah
Believe in your brother, have faith in man
Help each other, honey, if you can
Because it looks like everybody in this whole round world
Is down on meWhen I'm on the road playing in a town without a name
And I'm feeling low and everybody looks the same
Well, you catch my eye, and then you come on strong and try to make your play
Just because we loved tonight, please don't you think it's going to stay that way
Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand
Tomorrow I'll be on my way, and you can catch me if you can
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again, yeah
Everywhere I go, the people wanna make some time with me
That's okay, if the next day I can be free
Well, it's feeling good and you're the one I'm loving tonight
Well, don't you go and spoil it, babe, by trying to get yourself all uptight
Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand
Lord, Lord!Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
I got to be seeing you around
When I change my living standard and I move uptown
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
So long, my honey, so long
Too bad you had to drift away
Cause I could use some company
Right here on this road, on this road I am on today
I get the feeling I could chase you clean on in the ball
And wind up staying pull off, put down strung out and stalled
Honey, I have not got time to wait on you or to fetch your super ball
I got lots of things I have got to do
I know that you got things to do and places to be
I guess I will have to find the thing you placed on me
I may wind up in the street or sleep beneath a tree
Still I guess you know honey I have got to go
Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
I guess you know you are on your own
It seems you just got lost somewhere out in the world
And you left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
Bye, bye-bye baby, baby bye-bye!Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on baby you're the best there is

Come on baby, let's ride some more
Come on baby, rock me all night long!
Roll all night long

Always turns out the same
When I bring home my hard-earned pay
I spend my money all on Mary Jane
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Lord, my Mary Jane
Oh if a man should look tame now, mean and mature
They all turns out the same
Because they can't do nothing to make a man feel good
Like my old Mary Jane
Now I walk in the street now looking for a friend
One that can lend me some change
And he never questions my reason why
Because he too loves Mary Jane
Well I have known women that wanted no man
Some that wanted to say
But I never knew what happened in this world
Until I met up with Mary Jane
Oh when I'm feeling lonesome and I'm feeling blue
There's only one way to change
Now I walk down the street now looking for a man
One that knows my Mary JaneAlright, alright

Spending my money, no, I didn't care
Taking my friend out for a mighty good time
Buying high-priced liquor, champagne wine
Then one day I began to fall so low
Didn't have a friend, nor no place to go
If I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm going to hold on to it until the eagle grins
No, nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And your friends, well, you haven't any
Soon as I get back up on my feet again
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
It's might strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
That's what I mean, honey, when you're down and outPlease don't you think baby that I am wrong to cry, yeah
You loved me, too
So how come you just sit there and laugh
And laugh and laugh and laugh?
Things just can't be this way
And not for very long
No no no
Our love affair said it's just history, yes it is
And I tried to love you in my own way
I think that you know I did
But to have you here, to see you living
Oh so near to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh but you are distant and so it's dead
And so often people are glad to be old, yeah yeah
Our love affair is just history, yes it is
Once in a green time a flower
Oh, fell in love with the sun
The passion lasted for an hour
And then she wilted from her loved one
And I see you looking up at the sky, how high it is, yeah
You wonder if there is, whoa another me
Now how can that be, how can it be ?
Well, I sit here and I ask you, why all this?
I just got tonight
Our love affair said it's just a history
But baby, baby, I said it's over, Charlie
I can't stand another lonely
I'm never too lonely
It's over baby
Where were you when I wanted you
And needed you right by my side?

I know I hurt you, but Lord don't you know I cried
I know I hurt you, but babe don't you know I tried
Oh baby, oh babe, whoaOh, the cuckoo, she is a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July

Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
All of my gold, all of my gold
Well, Jack diamonds, oh Jack diamonds, oh I know you of old
Honey, you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold

And every time that she passes, my true love says good-bye
Well, says good-bye, well says good-bye
Ooh, oohWhoa, the last time that I saw you
Child, I know, no, you didn't say a word
And I knew, darling as I looked into your eyes
That my feelings, oh, they'd never been heard
Well, I'm talking to you about love
Did you hear me, I said love
Because it's got to be such a long, long, way
From denying, from denying
And I say, don't say no, no, no to me no more
And I believed in you all the time
Honey, until I found out, you know, that I was so wrong
Won't you try and build a life with you
Guess I should've known it, I guess I should've known it all along
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let me hold you just once more
Babe, I ask you just once more
Because it's got to be such a long, long way from crying
And I been crying and I got tears in my eyes
Yeah, but don't you know when you love somebody that's so precious
They can never, never, never be had very cheaply
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're going to have to pay your dues
And sometimes, sometimes I guess you're bound to lose
Hey, but that's the way
You're going to learn, learn, learn to love deeply
Now oh God, I wish I could explain that myself
Because I know that it's my fault, too
It's so easy to hurt you, darling
It's so hard, it's hard not to do
And I know that you showed me a new life
And you'll always, you'll always be my friend
Yeah, but I don't think, honey, that I can keep from trying
And I'll be trying and I been crying for you, baby
Yes, I have now
Well, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What would I do without you, child?
I'm afraid that I can't say
But I hope, honey, that when you will remember
Lord, it'll be, it'll be such a sunny day
Now, now, now, now, good-bye
I'll see you sometime
And don't be worried, everything's just fine
Babe, I don't think
That I can keep from dying

But I won't be blue always
Because that sun is going to shine in my back door someday
Now all you men are the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name
Lord, that sun's going to shine in my back door someday
I'm going to lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mindGot the blues from my baby
Left me by the San Francisco Bay
This big ocean liner took her so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad
She was the best girl I ever have had
She said good-bye, and she made me cry
I'm going to lay right down and die
Well, I haven't got a nickel and I haven't got a lousy dime
If she doesn't come back, I think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever comes back to stay
Well, that will be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
Sitting in my back door
Wondering which way to go
That woman I'm so crazy about
She doesn't love me no more
Lord, I think I'll grab a freight train
Because I'm feeling blue
Ride all the way to the end of the line
Thinking only about you
Well, meanwhile in another city
Just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby
The way she used called my nameHey baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey hey, hey hey child
Child, child, oh
Hey, hey, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, child
Say come on baby and tell me one more time
Alright, honey, come on baby and tell about it one more time
I said 25 minutes is all I have at hand
Said go, go and take me in your arms
Say go and take me in your arms
You can buy me a house, you can buy me anything you want
I want a house in the country at the time that I think came on
I want a house in the country at the time that I think came on
So I'll call you baby once when I need any more, heyOh well it's much too early, not right now
How can I love you when I, I don't know how
I don't know how, I don't know how?
How can I trust my eyes, do they really see
What is the truth? It's hard for me
Hard for me, hard for me
It's hard to understand what's really there
When all my hopes they just cloud the air
Cloud the air, cloud the air
Love is all around me, till we understand
It's easy to see baby, but talk to me
And love is all around us if we could be free
Love is all around us if we just, if we just try to see
Ooh wah ooh 
You say you need me, baby, as you breathe the words
That's time for you to leave, Oh no!
Time to leave, time to leave
Oh please, don't push me, baby, I might learn how to play your game
Now it's your turn
It's your turn, it's your turn
I'd love to love you now until I'll be sure
That this time your love won't hurt me more

Spending my money, no, I didn't care
Takin' my friend out for a mighty good time
Buyin' high-priced liquor, champagne wine
Then one day I began to fall so low
Didn't have a friend, nor no place to go
If I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm goin' to hold on to it until the eagle grins
No, nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And your friends, well, you haven't any
Soon as I get back up on my feet again
Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
It's might strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

I'm stealing, stealing, pretty mama, don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back my same old used-to-be
Well, I got a little woman, about my height and size
Now she's a married woman, sees me once in a while
With good whiskey you stay drunk all the time
Stay drunk baby because it eases my mindI went down to old Joe's bar room, on the corner by the square
Well, the drinks were being served as usual, and this motley crowd was there
Well, on my left stood Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
When he told me that sad story, these were the words he said
I went down to the St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, so cold, and fine, and fair
Go ahead
Let her go, let her go, God bless her, wherever she may be
She can search this world over, never find another man like me
Yes, sixteen coal black horses, to pull that rubber tied hack
Well, it's seventeen miles to the graveyard, but my baby's never coming back
Well, now you've heard my story, well, have another round of booze
And if anyone should ever, ever ask you, I've got the St. James infirmary bluesReady?

Man, will your daughter take on me?
Well, I don't know, I don't know
Oh man, will your daughter take on me?
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, boy, I don't knowHe brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin, Lord, to realize
If you don't think that, honey, you'll be lonesome
You know I'll drown, drown, oh Lord, in my own tears
I know it's true into his mind
A little rain is bound to fall
But since you been gone honey I'm so blue
It just keeps raining, keeps right on raining more and more
I didn't cry just like a child
My poor tears, Lord, they were running wild
If you don't think that baby you'll be home soon nowI know you rider, you're going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, you're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss your loving baby running, I said running in your arms

Doesn't the moon look lonesome, when it's shining down through the trees
