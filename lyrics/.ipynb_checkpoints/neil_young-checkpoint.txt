Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you wereCome a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moonI want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of goldTin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
An' once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my myI caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done
I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sunSouthern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?Oh, Alabama
The devil fools
With the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now, the moment
Is all that it meant
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows, down in Alabama
See the old folks
Tied in white robes
Hear the banjo
Don't it take you down home?
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing, Alabama?
You got the rest of the Union
To help you along
What's going wrong?Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my
Out of the blue and into the black
You pay for this, but they give you that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black
The King is gone, but he's not forgotten 
Is this the story of Johnny Rotten? 
It's better to burn out, 'cause rust never sleeps
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stayLook out, Mama, there's a white boat coming up the river
With a big red beacon, and a flag, and a man on the rail
I think you'd better call John
Because it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
And it's less than a mile away
I hope they didn't come to stay
It's got numbers on the side and a gun
And it's making big waves
Daddy's gone, my brother's out hunting in the mountains
Big John's been drinking since the river took Emmy-Lou
So the Powers That Be left me here to do the thinkin'
And I just turned twenty-two
I was wondering what to do
And the closer they got
The more those feelings grew
Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassuring
He said, Red means run, son, numbers add up to nothing
But when the first shot hit the docks I saw it coming
Raised my rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black
And my face splashed in the sky
Shelter me from the powder and the finger
Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
Think of me as one you'd never figured
Would fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love
I know I'll miss herOh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soonHello, cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile?
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
Hello, woman of my dreams
This is not the way it seems
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this gameWhen you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heartThink I'll pack it in
And buy a pick-up
Take it down to "L.A."
Find a place to call my own
And try to fix up
Start a brand new day
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling
See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
She got pictures on the wall
They make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road
Trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling
See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
OhThere’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free worldBe on my side
I'll be on your side
Baby
There is no reason
For you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride
Yeah, she could drag me
Over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, oh, shot her dead, oh
You take my hand
I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness
Is too much sorrow
It's impossible
To make it today
Yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah
She could drag me
Over the rainbow
And send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, dead, oh, oh, shot her dead
Shot her dead
Be on my side
I'll be on your side
There is no reason
For you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride
Uh, yeah
She could drag me
Over the rainbow
And send me away, yeah
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the riverShe used to work in a diner
Never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town
Never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
You know it ain't easy
You got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids
Looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathesHe came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
And that palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls, he often wondered
With the secrets of the world
And his subjects
Gathered around him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see
And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood
Straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on
Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones
They carried them
To the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up
With their bare hands
What we still can't do today
And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way
He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killerWell I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new homeOnce I thought I saw you
In a crowded hazy bar
Dancing on the light
From star to star
Far across the moonbeam
I know that's who you are
I saw your brown eyes
Turning once to fire
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away
I am just a dreamer
But you are just a dream
You could have been
Anyone to me
Before that moment
You touched my lips
That perfect feeling
When time just slips
Away between us
On our foggy trip
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown away
You are just a dreamer
And I am just a dream
You could have been
Anyone to me
Before that moment
You touched my lips
That perfect feeling
When time just slips
Away between us
On our foggy trip
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
To somewhere safer
Where the feeling stays
I want to love you but
I'm getting blown awayOld man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come aroundI got to bet
That your old man
Became fascinated
With his own plan
Turned you loose
Your mama too
There wasn't a thing
That you could do
But I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through
I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through
You really made my day
With the little things you say
Looking through
The window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
The greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
There's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window
Who was it made
Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
How'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
Took you down the track
Now all I've got for you
Is the kind of love
That cuts clean through
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean throughI wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Pa sent me money now
I'm going to make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeahSailin' hardships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?Back in the old folky days
The air was magic when we played
The riverboat was rocking in the rain
Midnight was the time for the raid
Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela
They tore you down and plowed you under
You're only real with your make-up on
How could I see you and stay too long?
All along the Navajo Trail
Burn-outs stub their toes
On garbage pails
Waitresses are crying in the rain
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?
Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skids
Shoe ain't happy, neither are the kids
She needs someone that she can scream at
And I'm such a heel for making her feel so bad
I guess I'll call it sickness gone
It's hard to say the meaning of this song
An ambulance can only go so fast
It's easy to get buried in the past
When you try to make a good thing last
I saw today in the entertainment section
There's room at the top for private detection
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper
So all you critics sit alone
You're no better than me for what you've shown
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together for some scenes
Well, I'm up in T.O. keeping jive alive
And out on the corner it's half past five
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes
Except for the Farmer's Market
And I still can hear him say:
You're all just pissing in the wind
You don't know it but you are
And there ain't nothing like a friend
Who can tell you you're just pissing in the wind
I never knew a man could tell so many lies
He had a different story for every set of eyes
How can he remember who he's talking to?
Because I know it ain't me and I hope it isn't youThe world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are fallin'
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day-to-day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm livin' out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
Went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town, get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Because the world is turnin'
I don't wanna see it turn awayDid I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we lose our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a manThey were hiding behind hay bales
They were planting
In the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water
Shone like diamonds in the dew
And I was just getting up
Hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw
Those thrashers rolling by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling
Like my day had just begun
Where the eagle glides descending
There's an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates
It was then I knew I'd had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement
Turns to sand
With a one-way ticket
To the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends
I still don't understand
They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting
So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road
Without that load
Brings back the time
When I was eight or nine
I was watching my mama's T.V
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode
Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar
But me I'm not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line
In the field of time
When the thrashers come
I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines
But I'll know the time has come
To give what's mineOn the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry
Through the night
I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall
Of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Amazon
You had so much
And now so much is gone
What are you going to do
With your life?
What a lucky man
To see the earth
Before it touched his hand
What an angry fool
To condemn
One more night to go
One more sleep
Upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows
What he's done
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls
Lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to natureSomeone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields, they were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the windows and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and saying hello
Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of age
If I was a junkman selling you cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder? And how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme
Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of ageMy life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could understand
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid
When will I see you again?One of these days
I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm going to try
And thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long
And I'm going to thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long
From down in L.A
All the way to Nashville
From New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be longComes a time when you're drifting
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light, feelings lifting
Lift that baby right up off the ground
Oh, this old world
Keeps spinning round
It's a wonder tall trees
Ain't layin' down
There comes a time
You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave awayI hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name, pass it around
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I do mine
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk onThink I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this wayHe's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner
There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something
That he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the lonerSometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all right
I've got my friends in the world
I had my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled
City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
I know I'll be all rightFrom Hank to Hendrix
I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar
Doing what I do
I always expected
That you should see me through
I never believed in much
But I believed in you
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?
From Marilyn to Madonna
I always loved your smile
Now we're headed
For the big divorce
California-style
I found myself singing
Like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?
Sometime it's distorted
Not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringing through
New glass in the window
New leaf on the tree
New distance between us
You and me
Can we get it together
Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last
Like a musical ride?Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long
Tonight's the night
Yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Early in the morning, at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
Because, people, let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well, early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
Tonight's the night
Yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

WhoaNever let 'em tell you no
Stand by the beach
And let's get warm by the fire
I had started this camp
Because I had the desire to spread good vibes
And it changed lives for the better
Better know that I've been changing at the same time
Sand in my toes
And my hand to the sky
I gaze upon the stars
And I simply reply
That with the same thing
That's what we think
But you don't gotta look nowhere near as far to reach me
Off of the shore and into the waves of the water
I spotted souls that were drowning
But didn't want to be bothered
It's just like watching a man
That's about to jump to his death
You gotta stop him from taking that last step
I spotted them by the buoy
Not knowing what they were doing
I jumped right in
Swam to them
And put them onto the movement
Back at the beach
We warmed them up with the fire
And drown their sorrow with love
In waves of thoughts that inspire
Stand up, twirl down
Turn up your sound
Never let them tell you no
Never let them tell you no
I met a man at the end of his rope
His pockets were broke
He was addicted to dope
When asked his worth
He couldn't give me a quote
Not 'cause he thought he was priceless
Just that his price was too low
I said, "My brother, from another mother
You gotta free yourself from this chair
And lift yourself from whatever you're under
'Cause you know you got a story to tell"
Stand up, twirl down
Turn up your sound
Never let them tell you no
Times when profound
No one's around
Never let them tell you no
Never let them tell you no
I met a woman at the end of her wits
She had taken some scars
And she was swinging, she missed
She tried working so hard
That she was ready to quit
And when I asked her worth
Her reply made me sick
I said, "My sister, I'm tryin' to get with ya
Fuck a job
I'll fill you as well
Just change your focus
Still keep working
You just gotta be a boss by yourself"
Stand up, twirl down
Turn up your sound
Never let them tell you no
Times when profound
No one's around
Never let them tell you no
Never let them tell you noWell, we live in a trailer at the edge of town
You never see us because we don't come around
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down
But we need you now and that's why
I'm hanging around
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you
And in this land of conditions
I'm not above suspicion
I won't attack you but I won't back you
Well, it's so good to be here asleep on your lawn
Remember your guard dog?
Well, I'm afraid that he's gone
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long
Yes, that was me with the doves setting them free near the factory
Where you built your computer love
I hope you get the connection because I can't take the rejection
I won't deceive you, I just don't believe you
Well, I'm a barrel of laughs with my carbine on
I keep 'em hopping until my ammunition's gone
But I'm still not happy
I feel like there's something wrong
I got the revolution blues
I see bloody fountains
And ten million dune buggies coming down the mountains
Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars
But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their carsI'm an accident, I was driving way too fast
Couldn't stop though, so I let the moment last
I'm for rolling, I'm for tossing in my sleep
It's not guilt though, it's not the company I keep
People my age, they don't do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And I've got my friends, and I've got my family too
And I got her love, she's got my love too
And I can't hear you, but I feel the things you say
And I can't see you, but I see what's in my way
Now I'm floating, 'cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound
On the long plain, see the rider in the night
See the chieftain, see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life?
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife?
Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen
Rows of lovers, parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens echoing across the bay
To the old boats from the city far away
Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
And rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown
They play baseball, they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction, need romance and candlelight
Need random violence, need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence, want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love
I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain, fell into bed alone
Started dreaming, saw the rider once again
In the doorway, where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him
I'm not present, I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an aerostar, I'm a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane, trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertowOpen up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in
I was thinking of you and me
Making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be
Thinking about the times we had
Some were good and some were bad
Guitar fighting the T.V
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me
Looking at you just the other night
Dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
Old man sitting there
Touch of grey, but he don't care
When he hears his children call
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me
Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back inSong without a home
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen
They killed us in our teepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen
And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome
And the first teepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
PocahontasKing went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
There in my truck the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about the times we had
Once when I kicked him when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did know
That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog that was half as fine
I may find one, you never do know
Because I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went a-running after deer
Wasn't scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went a-sniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog
I ever did knowI am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul
Traffic cops are all color blind
People steal from their own kind
Evening comes too early for a stroll
Down neon streets the streaker streaks
The speaker speaks but the truth still leaks
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul
The podium rocks in the crowded waves
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before
He played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines
Test tube genes and slot machines
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul
Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goalYou are such a woman to me
And I love you
Our love will live
Until the end of all time
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you
You are such a woman to meWhen your summer days come tumbling down
And you find yourself alone
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you
Yes i'd miss you
But i never want to hold you down
You might say i'm here for you
When the winter comes to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you
In the spring, protective arms surrounding you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness i know will always find you
And when it does, i hope that it will stayWhen the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a
Chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it nowLa la la la la la la la la
Ooh
It's going to take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's going to take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
It's going to take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's going to take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
'cause my head needs relating
Not solitude
Gotta lotta love 
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh
Ooh
It's going to take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's going to take a lotta love
Or we won't get too farLover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today
When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Nestled in your wings, my little one
This special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today
When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's overI'm a dreaming man
Yes, that's my problem
I can't tell
When I'm not being real
In the meadow dusk
I park my Aerostar
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright
I see your curves and
I feel your vibrations
You dressed in black and white you lost in the mall
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations
Another sleepless night a sun that won't fall
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright
Now the night is gone a new day is dawning
And our homeless dreams go back to the street
Another time or place another civilization
Would really make this life feel so complete
I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's alright
Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming man
Dreaming man
He's got a problem
Dreaming manLove is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine
I want to see what's never been seen
I want to live that age old dream
Come on, lass, we can go together
Let's take the best right now
Take the best right now
I wanna go to an old hoedown
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are dragging
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine, mine, mine
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a roseIn the morning when i wake up and listen to the sound
Of the birds outside on the roof
I try to ignore what the paper says
And i try not to read all the news
And i'll hold you if you had a bad dream
And i hope it never comes true
Because you and i been through so many things together
And the sun starts climbing the roof
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading away
It's only a dream
Just a memory without anywhere to stay
The red river stills flows through my home town
Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
Swirling around the old bridge pylons
Where a boy fishes the morning away
His bicycle leans on an oak tree
While the cars rumble over his head
An aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky
And the young birds call out to be fed
An old man walks along on the sidewalk
Sunglasses and an old stetson hat
The four winds blow the back of his overcoat away
As he stops with the policeman to chat
And a train rolls out of the station
That was really something in its day
Picking up speed on the straight prairie rails
As it carries the passengers away
It's a dream
Only a dream
And it's fading now
Fading awayAll the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
Singing songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter
All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade
All the Bush League batters
Are left to die on the diamond
In the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past, find someone new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past, find someone new
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome meA lonely man I made myself to be
It's not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
It's only reality the way it seems
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone
I'm riding down this wet road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for star shine
The party ended long before the night
But she made me feel alive and that's all right
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone
The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's goneOh hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught
That my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace
Of my face could seem so pleasing?
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on
I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange, but don't change"
And I let her
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick
Does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face
Is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change?
I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange I should change?
I don't
Is it strange I should change?
I don'tThe little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again
Ears ringing from the battle fire
The tired warrior aims a little higher
The black falcon or the little sparrow
The healing light or the flash of the barrel
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
Silver mane flying in the wind
Down through the planets on the run again
No one knows where they're running to
But every kind is coming two by two
Out on the delta
Where the hoofbeats pound
The daddy's running on the frozen ground
Can't smell the poison as it follows him
Can't see the gas and machines, it's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
The windows open and the little girl dreams
The sky's her playground as she mounts her steed
Across the heavens to the other side
On wings of magic does the little girl ride
The baby creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of manWhen I was a young boy
My mama said to me
Your daddy's leaving home today
I think he's gone to stay
We packed up all our bags
And drove out to Winnipeg
When we got to Winnipeg
I checked in to school
I wore white bucks on my feet
When I learned the golden rule
The punches came fast and hard
Lying on my back in the school yard
Don't be denied, don't be denied 
Well pretty soon I met a friend
He played guitar
We used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
We started a band
We played all night
Oh Canada
We played all night
I really hate to leave you now
But to stay just wouldn't be right
Down in Hollywood
We played so good
The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the Sunset Strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right
Well, all that glitters isn't gold
I know you've heard that story told
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a business man's eyes
Oh friend of mine
Don't be deniedSo many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you
It’s not that we got anything new
It’s not that it’s any better or worse
The way life treats us is a blessing and a curse
I’m glad I found you
When you’re walking in a crowded place
I’ll try to hide you and give you space
And I’ll protect you from the things that come
I’m glad I found you
The other day when you took my hand
We walked away to the promised land
When I feel your soul in mine
I’m glad I found you
Glad I found you in this sad world
Where so many things have gone wrong
It took me so long just to find you
Right where we belong
I’m glad I found you in this mad world
You’re a lifeline to me
And when I hold you I will shield you
From the things that we both see
So many people don’t understand
What it’s like to be like me
But I’m not different from anyone else
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found you
I’m glad I found youPeople, pick up on what I'm putting down now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Down at every laundromat in town now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
While they're washing, you can hear this sound now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!
Hard to believe that love is free now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Out on the street with the whole family now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Hard to believe that love is free now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!
People, pick up on what I'm putting down now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Down at every laundromat in town now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
While they're washing, you can hear this sound now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth

I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
Well, I'm a black bat, babe, I need my high octane
Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go

I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, babe, sell you twenty barrels worth
Good times are comingI am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there
God gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there
I am a child, I'll last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smileDon't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around me
Because when all the water's gone
The feeling lingers on
Old true love
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
Well I wonder
Who's with her tonight?
And I wonder
Who's holding her tight?
But there's nothing I can say
To make him go away
Old true love
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
There's nothing I can say
To make him go away
Old true love
Ain't too hard to see
Don't cry no tears around me
Don't cry no tears around meI'm Canadian by the way
And I love the USA
I love this way of life
The freedom to act
And the freedom to say
Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand
Woke up this morning
Thinking about you and your new deal
Tried to put myself in your shoes
Tried to feel how you feel
Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand
No wall
No ban
No fascist USA
No wall

Not my words
That’s just you the other day out on that street
You’re looking at one of the lucky ones
Came here from there to be free
Got to chase the life with Freedom land
Got to play my part in God’s plan
Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand
No wall

Whose streets?
Our streets See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain
Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?
I was down in Dixie Land
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle
See the sky about to rainMotion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
I've got mine
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is falling
The ducks are calling
Yes, I've got mine
Well, all those people, they think they got it made
But I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
I'd rather start all over again
Well, all those headlines, they just bore me now
I'm deep inside myself, but I'll get out somehow
And I'll stand before you
And I'll bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner forty niner
And his daughter clementine
Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for clementine
Clementine! Clementine!
Oh my darling, clementine!
Drove she ducklings to the water
Every morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine
Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, i was no swimmer
So i lost my clementine
Then the miner forty niner
Soon began to peak and pine
Thought he ought'er join his daughter
Now he's with his clementine
In my dreams she still does haunt me
Robed in garments soaked in brine
Though in life i used to hug her
In death i draw the line
How i missed her! How i missed her
How i missed my clementine
So i kissed her little sister
I forgot my clementineWhen you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
I can love, I can really love, I can really love
Like a mountain that's growing, a river that rolls
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love
When you dance do your senses tingle then take a chance?
In a trance, while the lonely mingle with circumstance?
I got something to tell you, you made it show
Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really loveIt's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the mornin' sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out, mama, 'cause I'm comin' home tonight
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of these open-hearted people goin' down
I'm not goin' back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to see that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe I'll be goin' back that way
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of these open-hearted people goin' downThere's a lot to learn
For wasting time
There's a heart that burns
There's an open mind
Look out for my love 
You own it, you own it now, you own it
There's a weight on you
But you can't feel it
Living like I do
It's hard for you to see it
Was I hurt too bad
Can I show you daylight
How could I be sad
When I know that you might
Look out for my love 
Look out for my love
It's in your neighborhood
I know things are gonna change
But I can't say bad or good
Silver wings of morning
Shining in the gray day
While the ice is forming
On a lonely runway
Hydraulic wipers pumping
Until the window glistens
Something saying something
No one seems to listen
Men with walkie-talkies
Men with flashlights waving
Up upon the tower
Time reads daylight savings
I'm home again to you babe
You know it makes me wonder
Sitting in the quiet slipstream
In the thunder
Look out for my love Remember the Alamo
When help was on the way
It's better here and now
I feel that good today
I'd like to take a walk
But not around the block
I really got some news
I met a man from Mars
He picked up all my guitars
And played me travelling songs
And when we got on ship
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive would
I'm going to ride my llama
From Peru to Texarkana
I want to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
I'm going to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive wouldDarlin', the door is open
To my heart and I've been hopin'
That you won't be the one
To struggle with the key
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
The waitin' time is over
No man sees around the corner
Walkin' in the rain and comin' home dry
There's something missin' there
It's easier to care and try
And I try to wash my hands 
And I try to make amends 
And I try to count my friends 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
I'd like to take a chance
But shit, Mary, I can't dance
So here's to lookin' up your old address
Golly what a mess
We gotta take the rest and try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
We got lots of time
To get together if we tryI could live inside a tepee
I could die In Penthouse thirty-five
You could lose me on the freeway
But I would still make it back alive
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away
See the losers in the best bars
Meet the winners in the dives
Where the people are the real stars
All the rest of their lives
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away
There's a road
Stretched out between us
Like a ribbon on the high plain
Down from Phoenix through Salinas
Around the bend and back again
As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail awayNow that you found yourself
Losing your mind
Are you here again?
Finding that what you once
Thought was real
Is gone, and changing?
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think
I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
I believe in you
I believe in you
Coming to you at night
I see my questions
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe
In a year or two
We could laugh
And let it all out
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think
I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
I believe in you
I believe in youHello cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command
Can I stay here for a while
Can I see your sweet sweet smile
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
Hello ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust
After all the sin we've had
I was hopin' that we turn back
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
Hello woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this gameLast night I was cool
At the pool hall
Held the table for eleven games
Nothing was easier
Than the first seven
I beat a woman with varicose veins
She stopped to see
Herself in the mirror
Fix her hair and hide her veins
And she lost the game
Next day I went to the dentist
He pulled some teeth
And I lost some blood
We'd like to thank you
For the cards you sent us
My wives and I were all choked up
I recall how Caesar and Cleo
Made love in the Milky Way
They needed boats
And armies to get there
I know there's a better way
I saw the movie and I read the book
But when it happened to me
I sure was glad I had what it took
To get away
Got to get away, got to get away
Got to get away, got to get away
Got to get away, got to get outta here
Got to get away, got to get away
Got to get away, got to get away
Got to get away, got to get away
I got to get away
I'm making another delivery
Of chemicals and sacred roots
I'll hold what you have to give me
But I'll use what I have to use
The lasers are in the lab
The old man
Is dressed in white clothes
Everybody says he's mad
No one knows
The things that he knows
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
I'm sleeping in every hallway
I just can't accept the stares
I'm using too many covers
I'm warm now so I don't care
I'm thinking of no one in my mind
Sedan delivery
Is a job I know I'll keep
It sure was hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find, ohAin't singing for Pepsi
Ain't singing for Coke
I don't sing for nobody
Makes me look like a joke
This note's for you
[Verse
Not singing for Miller
Don't sing for Bud
I won't sing for politicians
Ain't singing for Spuds
This note's for you
Don't want no cash
Don't need no money
Ain't got no stash
This note's for you
I've got the real thing
I got the real thing, baby
I got the real thing
Yeah, alrightDon't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message around her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
And when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all rightI used to walk like a giant on the land
Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream
I wanna walk like a giant
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Me and some of my friends
We were gonna save the world
We were trying to make it better
We were ready to save the world
But then the weather changed
And the white got stained
And it fell apart
And it breaks my heart
But think about how close we came
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Tried to head for long and straight
We were riding on the desert wind
We were pulling in the spiritual
Riding on the desert wind
We could see it in the distance
Getting closer every minute
We saw the lights and spiritual shining
Getting closer every minute
Then we skipped the rails
And we started to fail
And we folded up
And it's not enough
Think about how close we came
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Whenever I see the big fire coming
Coming to burn down all my ideas
I try to hold on to my thinking
And remember how it feels
When I'm looking right in your eyes
And hearing your happy laughter
When I'm seeing your blue eyes shining
And hear your happy laughter
So the moment came
And the big sky rained
And it put out the fire
Except in my desire
When I think about how good it feels
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I used to walk like a giant on the land
Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream
I wanna walk like a giant
I wanna walk like a giant on the landI come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind
I come down from the crooked mansion
I went looking
For the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line
Now, my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind
Now, my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkindThere's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard
Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings
Could be good things
In the air for you
We are leaving. We are gone
Come with us to all alone
Never worry. Never moan
We will leave you all alone
In the mountains, in the cities
You can see the dream
Look around you. Has it found you?
Is it what it seems?
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hardI've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could it be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time nowSlipping and sliding
And playing domino
Lefting and then Righting
It's not a crime you know
You got to tell your story boy
Before it's time to go
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go? 
I was talking to the preacher
Said God was on my side
Then I ran into the hangman
He said it's time to die
You gotta tell your story boy
You know the reason whyCome on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Walk on, talk on, baby tell no lies
Don't you be caught with a tear in your eye
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Snake eyes, French fries and I got lots of gas
Full moon and a jumping tune, now you don't have to ask
Sure enough, they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Come on, baby, let's go downtown
Let's go, let's go, let's go downtown
Walk on, talk on, baby tell no lies
Don't you be caught with a tear in your eye
Sure enough they'll be selling stuff
When the moon begins to rise
Pretty bad when you're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyes
Pretty bad when
You're dealing with the man
And the light shines in your eyesWell, I used to drive a cab you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"
Well, I used to be a woman you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
"Let's get on with this thing"
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said
Well, I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I could not
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his backHey, hey
Cripple Creek ferry
Butting through
The overhanging trees
Make way
For the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down
It's a mighty tight squeeze
All alone the captain stands
Hasn't heard
From his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
It's the second half
Of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose
Hey, hey
Cripple Creek ferry
Butting through
The overhanging trees
Make way
For the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down
It's a mighty tight squeezeIt has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears
When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching from the strain
I'm swimming in my sleep
I know I can't go back again
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
I'll never lose it
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
It's like something from up above
I can be like a fire in the night
Always warm and giving off light
But there comes a time when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night
And now my fins are in the air
And my belly is scraping on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming 'til I stop
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me
It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care
But I'll never lose
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
Never lose the will to love
It's like something from up above
Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself 'til all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again
I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger and I can't, won't be tamed
But I'll never lose the will to love
Never lose the will to love
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
I'm not gonna lose the will to love
Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride
If we meet along the way, please sway beside me
Let us sway together, our tails together
And our fins and mind will leave this water
And let our scales shine
In the sun above and the sky below
So all the water and earth will know
It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't thereI'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters
I'm having my doubts
I'm watching the skaters
Fly by on the lake
Ice frozen six feet deep
How long does it take?
I look out on peaceful lands
With no war nearby
An ocean of shaking hands
That grab at the sky
I'm singing this borrowed tune
I took from the Rolling Stones
Alone in this empty room
Too wasted to write my own
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it mattersShow me that garden in the sun that you saw
Let me see the flowers and the bees before they fall
I know that you says they'll always be there
I know you're not worried and I know you care
And I know you ask all the same questions I do
I do
I do
Show me that flock of birds that filled the sky
Let me see the way they block the sun from my eye
I know you said they'd always be there
I know you're not worried, I know you care
I know you ask all the same questions I do
I do
I do
Why do I believe in you?
Why do I believe in you?
Why do I believe in you?
Show me that water in the stream that you saw
Let me see the sparkling clean and the fish swimming on
I know you said they'll always be there
I know you're not worried and I know you care
I know you ask all the same questions I do
I do
I do
I do
Thanks for making all this happen again
We're gonna do it just like we did back then
I know that you said you'd always be there
And I know you're not worried, and I know you care
I know you ask all the same questions I do
I do
I do
I do
Why do I believe in you?
Why do I believe in you?
Why do I believe in you?Talk to the people
They know the truth
Time don't mean nothing
It's the ways that you choose
To go on living inside your house
Or move a mountain, an elephant or a mouse
Instead of stayin and dying inside
Sometimes you move
Sometimes you ride away
Don't tell no stories
Don't tell no lies
Not even the ones you already tried
Not proud of lies
Nothing is saved
Just a road to nowhere, your name engraved
They pick up on you
As you pick up on them
Just cause they're birds don't mean you can't fly
So don't be sorry
The pastor touched my hand
Here on the church steps
I was 9 or 10
I had a change of heart
Was a change of heart
A change of heart
Life is confusing
Love is time bent
Hate is not worth using
Even as cement
To build your walls
That you hide behind
And not see over and it blows your mind
There's hate there now
That never was
Love is waiting just because of you cuz
There's nothing sacred
A blind man said
I see your feelings inside my head
I can't predict it, what happens next
I love a future I don't expect
You fortune tellers
You take my hand
See what's there
It's sifting sands
I had a change of heart
It was a change of heart
Just a change of heart
I was the ocean
Washed up here
I'm your emotions
I'm your fresh beard
So drink me up and laugh away
And let's all continue on another day
Maybe tomorrow our ship will come in
And we'll set the sails for oblivion
Not so fast
Let's not give up
Let's don't be angry
And spill the cup
Well we're still drinking
And I'm feeling so high
My eyes are waterlogged, let's give it a try
Come on baby, I'm ready to rock
Give me all you've got
And then let's talk
It's a change of heart
I had a change of heart
Just a change of heartWhen I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just pass on through
You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again
But I didn't have the cash
I didn't have the cash
Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my 48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last
Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter
But the neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes
Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen
Living in the country
Looked good to me
Smoking grass while the summer passed
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green
Then we had a kid and we split apart
I was living on the road
And a little cocaine went a long, long way
To ease that different load
And my head did explode
My head did explode
I thought I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru
Now many years have come and gone
Like friends and enemies
I tried to leave my past behind
But it's catching up with me
It's catching up with me
I don't know how I'm standing here
Living my life
I'm thankful for my children
And my faithful wifeI'm going to give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm going to give you till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
I'm only waiting till the morning comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comesIn a matter of time
There'll be a friend of mine
Going to come to the coast
You're going to see him
Up close for a minute or two
While the ground cracks under you
By the look in your eyes
You'd think that it was a surprise
But you seem to forget
Something somebody said
About the bubbles in the sea
And an ocean full of trees
And you now, L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too? 
Well, it's hard to believe
So you get up to leave
And you laugh at the door
That you heard it all before
Oh it's so good to know
That it's all just a show for you
But when the suppers are planned
And the freeways are crammed
And the mountains erupt
And the valley is sucked
Into cracks in the earth
Will I finally be heard by you
L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too? I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good
My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water for everyone to see
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy
I saw him in Nassau in 1971
His strength was failing but he still ran a run
He worked till his fingers wore to the bone
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own
He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
That steel hull freighter was passing its time
And time flew by faster with life on the sea
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy
I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill goodThere's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
But there's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin'  in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free worldFourteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks
Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
Until the break of day
Because you know
How time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
All day presidents
Look out windows
All night sentries
Watch the moon glow
All are waiting until
The time is right
Back in Canada
I spent my days
Riding subways
Through a haze
I was handcuffed
I was born & raised
Thirteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks
Time fades away
You know how time fades awayShe'll be coming round the mountain when she comes
