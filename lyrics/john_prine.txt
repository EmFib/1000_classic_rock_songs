She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
She's my baby, I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her go
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp, but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby and I'm his honey
I'm never gonna let him go
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
She takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her go
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked-out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
He's my baby, I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him go
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
In spite of ourselvesI am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning, thunder were desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl, well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just a free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken-down dam
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em, they're buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say?
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to goSam Stone came home to his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas
And the time that he served had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in his knee
But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back
There's a hole in Daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...
Sam Stone's welcome home didn't last too long
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And Sammy took to stealing when he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime
And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearin' other people's clothes
There's a hole in Daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...
Sam Stone was alone when he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air
But life had lost its fun
And there was nothing to be done
But trade his house that he bought on the G.I. Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill
There's a hole in Daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm...Summer's end is around the bend just flyin'
The swimmin' suits are on the line just dryin'
I'll meet you there per our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation
Well you never know how far from home you're feelin'
Until you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'
Well I don't know, but I can see it snowin'
In your car, the windows are wide open
Just come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home
Valentines break hearts and minds at random
That old Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'
Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home
The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted
Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Come on home
Come on home
You donâ€™t have to be alone
Just come on homeWhen I woke up this morning, things were looking bad
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down and won
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized that I was having no fun
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just trying to have me some fun
Last time I checked my bankroll, it was getting thin
Sometimes it seems like the bottom is the only place I've been
Chased a rainbow down a one-way street, dead end
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just trying to have me some fun
Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
Trying to get away from all the ears inside my walls
I dreamed the police heard everything I thought, what then?
Well I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just trying to have me some fun
Well done
Hot dog bun
My sister's a nunI know a guy that's got a lot to lose
He's a pretty nice fellow, but kind of confused
He's got muscles in his head that ain't never been used
Thinks he own half of this town
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose
Then he takes her out to dinner, buys her new clothes
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next, you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
I was sitting in the bathtub counting my toes
When the radiator broke, water all froze
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown
I was crying ice cubes, hoping I'd croak
When the sun come through the window, the ice all broke
I stood up and laughed, thought it was a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next, you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next, you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'roundI wish you love and happiness
I guess I wish you all the best
I wish you don't do like I do
And never fall in love with someone like you
'Cause if you fell just like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But kids don't know, they can only guess
How hard it is to wish you happiness
I guess that love is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree, you throw it in the yard
It decays and dies and the snowmen melt
Well, I once knew love, I knew how love felt
Yeah I knew love, love knew me
And when I walked, love walked with me
And I got no hate and I got no pride
Well, I got so much love that I cannot hide
Yeah, I got so much love that I cannot hide
Say you drive a Chevy, say you drive a Ford
You say you drive around the town till you just get bored
Then you change you mind for something else to do
And your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you
Well it's a doggone shame and it's an awful mess
I wish you love, I wish you happiness
I wish you love, I wish you happiness
I guess I wish you all the bestWhen I get to heaven, I'm gonna shake God's hand
Thank Him for more blessings than one man can stand
Then I'm gonna get a guitar and start a rock and roll band
Check into a swell hotel; ain't the afterlife grand?
And then I'm gonna get a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale
Yeah, I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the Tilt-a-whirl
'Cause this old man is goin' to town
Then as God as my witness, I'm gettin' back into show business
I'm gonna open up a nightclub called The Tree of Forgiveness
And forgive everybody ever done me any harm
Why, I might even invite a few choice critics, those syphilitic parasitics
Buy 'em a pint of Smithwick's and smother 'em with my charm
'Cause then I'm gonna get a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale
Yeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the Tilt-a-whirl
Yeah this old man is goin' to town
When I get to heaven, I'm gonna take that wristwatch off my arm
What are you gonna do with time after you've bought the farm?
And then I'm gonna go find my mom and dad and good old brother Doug
Why, I bet him and cousin Jackie are still cuttin' up a rug
I wanna see all my mama's sisters 'cause that's where all the love starts
I miss them all like crazy, bless their little hearts
And I always will remember these words my daddy said
He said, "Buddy, when you're dead, you're a dead peckerhead"
I hope to prove him wrong, that is, when I get to heaven
'Cause I'm gonna have a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale
Yeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the Tilt-a-whirl
Yeah this old man is goin' to town
Yeah this old man is goin' to townI'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride till the sun comes up and down
Around about two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing this song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again
I'd like to stay, but I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas
Or go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to being alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again
I'm tired of runnin' round lookin' for answers
To questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights
That it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again
When I know what to say
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station
Gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side
Ride till the sun comes up and down
Around about two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing my song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again
When I know what to sayMy heart's in the ice house, come hill or come valley
Like a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley
On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked, gettin' neutered
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow
You can gaze out the window, get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say "What does it matter?"
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me, I know
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You'll become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair
And my head shouted down to my heart
"You better look out below!"
It ain't such a long drop, don't stammer, don't stutter
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter
And you carry those bruises
To remind you wherever you go
You can gaze out the window, get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say "What does it matter?"
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me, I know
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You'll become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrow
My heart's in the ice house, come hill or come valley
Like a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley
On a cold winter's morning to a church house
Just to shovel some snow
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked, gettin' neutered
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter
Just from walking with his back turned
To the train that was coming so slow
You can gaze out the window, get mad and get madder
Throw your hands in the air, say "What does it matter?"
But it don't do no good to get angry
So help me, I know
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter
You'll become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own
Chain of sorrowWe had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown
A life of their own left us alone
John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean War
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore
You know that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder every day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello."
Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the backdoor screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if he asks "What's new?"
"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do."
You know that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder every day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello."
So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass 'em by and stare
As if you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello."I got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything, but one of me
And when the rains came tumbling down
I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing out to sea
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
I caught an aisle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes and red balloons
So I called up my local DJ
And he didn't have a lot to say
'Cause the radio has learned all of my favorite tunes
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon
And besides that, we never liked you any way
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge will prevail without failShe was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal
Well she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, she gave me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke
Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own
Well, I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
For I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo
Yeah she sang her song all night long, telling me what to do
Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own
Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
When just as I was leaving, well she looked me in the face
I said, "You must know the answer."
She said, "No but I'll give it a try."
And to this very day we've been living our way
And here is the reason why
We blew up our TV, threw away our paper
Went to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their ownWhen I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn
And Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill
And Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
And Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
When I die, let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am
And Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it awayI woke up this morning to a garbage truck
Looks like this old horseshoe's done run out of luck
If I came home, would you let me in
Fry me some pork chops and forgive my sin?
Surround me with your boundless love
Confound me with your boundless love
I was drowning in a sea, lost as I could be
When you found me with your boundless love
Sometimes my old heart is like a washing machine
It bounces around till my soul comes clean
And when I'm clean and hung out to dry
I'm gonna make you laugh until you cry
Surround me with your boundless love
Confound me with your boundless love
I was drowning in a sea, lost as I could be
When you found me with your boundless love
If by chance, I should find myself at risk
Of falling from this jagged cliff
I look below and I look above
I'm surrounded by your boundless love
Surround me with your boundless love
Confound me with your boundless love
I was drowning in a sea, lost as I could be
When you found me with your boundless love
You dumbfound me with your boundless love
You surround me with your boundless loveThe lonesome friends of science say
"The world will end most any day"
Well, if it does, then that's okay
'Cause I don't live here anyway
I live down deep inside my head
Where long ago I made my bed
I get my mail in Tennessee
My wife, my dog, and my family
Poor old planet Pluto now
He never stood a chance no how
When he got uninvited to
The interplanetary dance
Once a mighty planet there
Now just an ordinary star
Hanging out in Hollywood
In some old funky sushi bar
The lonesome friends of science say
"The world will end most any day"
Well, if it does, then that's okay
'Cause I don't live here anyway
I live down deep inside my head
Where long ago I made my bed
I get my mail in Tennessee
My wife, my dog and my kids and me
The Vulcan lives in Birmingham
Sometimes he just don't give a damn
His head is full of bumblebees
His pride hangs down below his knees
Venus left him long ago
For a guy named Mars from Idaho
The Vulcan sent a wedding gift
Three-legged stool and a wheelchair lift
The lonesome friends of science say
"This world will end most any day"
Well, if it does, then that's okay
'Cause I don't live here anyway
I live down deep inside my head
Where long ago I made my bed
I get my mail in Tennessee
My wife, my dog, my kids and me
Those bastards in their white lab coats
Who experiment with mountain goats
Should leave the universe alone
It's not their business, not their home
I go to sleep and it never rains
My dog predicts hurricanes
She can smell a storm a mile away
That's all the news we have today
The lonesome friends of science say
"The world will end most any day"
Well, if it does, then that's okay
'Cause I don't live here anyway
I live down deep inside my head
Where long ago I made my bed
I get my mail in Tennessee
My wife, my dog, my kids and meI been thinking lately about the people I meet
The carwash on the corner and the hole in the street
The way my ankles hurt with shoes on my feet
And I'm wondering if I'm gonna see tomorrow
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
I was in the army, but I never dug a trench
I used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench
I'd go to town and drink and give the girls a pinch
But I don't think they ever even noticed me
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
Eat everything that they put on your dish
And when we get through, we'll make a big wish
That we never have to do this again again again
On my very first job, I said thank you and please
They made me scrub a parking lot down on my knees
Then I got fired for being scared of bees
And they only give me fifty cents an hour
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
Eat everything that they put on your dish
And when we get through, we'll make a big wish
That we never have to do this again again again
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
We'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
We'll whistle and go fishing in heavenSome humans ain't human
Some people ain't kind
You open up their hearts
And here's what you'll find
A few frozen pizzas
Some ice cubes with hair
A broken popsicle
You don't wanna go there
Some humans ain't human
Though they walk like we do
They live and they breathe
Just to turn your old screw
They screw you when you're sleeping
They try to screw you blind
Some humans ain't human
Some people ain't kind
You might go to church
You sit down in a pew
Those humans who ain't human
Could be sittin' right next to you
They talk about your family
They talk about your clothes
When they don't know their own ass
From their own elbows
Jealousy and stupidity
Don't equal harmony
Jealousy and stupidity
Don't equal harmony
Have you ever noticed?
When you're feeling really good
There's always a pigeon
That'll come shit on your hood
Or you're feeling your freedom
And the world's off your back
Some cowboy from Texas
Starts his own war in Iraq
Some humans ain't human
Some people ain't kind
They lie through their teeth
With their head up their behind
You open up their hearts
And here's what you'll find
Some humans ain't human
Some people ain't kindThe dark and distant drumming
The pounding of the hooves
The silence of everything that moves
Late at night you see them
Decked out in shiny jewels
The coming of the caravan of fools
Like the wings of a dove
The waiter's white glove
Seems to shimmer by the light of the pool
Some dull, blinding winter
When you can't help but lose
You're running with the caravan of fools
Love and devotion
Deep as any ocean
Don't play by anybody's rules
With your carousel of horses
And your unforeseen forces
You're running with the caravan of fools
Caravan of fools, caravan of fools
You're running with the caravan of foolsWoke up this morning
Put on my slippers
Walked in the kitchen and died
And oh what a feeling
When my soul went through the ceiling
And on up into heaven I did ride
When I got there they did say
John, it happened this way
You slipped upon the floor and hit your head
And all the angels say
Just before you passed away
These were the very last words that you said
Please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears, if they don't mind the size
Give my stomach to Milwaukee
If they run out of beer
Put my socks in a cedar box
Just get 'em out of here
Venus de Milo can have my arms
Look out, I've got your nose
Sell my heart to the junkman
And give my love to Rose
Please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears, if they don't mind the size
Give my feet to the footloose
Careless, fancy free
Give my knees to the needy
Don't pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walking cane
It's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south
And kiss my ass goodbye
Please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears, if they don't mind the sizeI got a friend in Fremont, he sells used cars, ya know?
Well, he calls me up twice a year
Just to ask me how'd it go
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same
I met a girl from Venus, her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did, said "How was it, kid?"
She was politely told
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same"
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
'Cause actually, all them dogs are just about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast
And up in the sky an Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
'Cause actually, all them gods are just about the same
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
'Cause actually, everything is just about the sameWhile digesting Reader's Digest
In the back of the dirty book store
A plastic flag with gum on the back
Fell out on the floor
Well, I picked it up and I went outside
And slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see ol' Betsy Ross
I'd tell her how good I feel
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reasons for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
Well, I went to the bank this morning
And the cashier said to me
"If you join the Christmas club
We'll give you ten of them flags for free."
Well, I didn't mess around a bit
I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car
And one on my wife's forehead
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reasons for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
Well, I got my window shield so filled
With flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb
And right into a tree
By the time they got a doctor down
I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man
Standing in the Pearly Gates said
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reasons for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymoreIf you like your apples sweet
And your streets are not concrete
You'll be in your bed by nine every night
Take your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal
And your best friend's four-eyed pal
To a treat right down the street, that's dynamite
Let your conscience be your guide
If you put your foot inside
You'll wish you left your well-enough alone
When you got hell to pay
Put the truth on layaway
And blame it on that old Crazy Bone
Crazy Bone 
Crazy Bone 
Well you wished you'd left your well-enough alone
When you got hell to pay
Put the truth on layaway
And blame it on that old Crazy Bone
Don't be stuck up in Alaska
When you should be in Nebraska
On a Thursday when it's Egg & Daughter Nite
When the farmers come to town
And they spread them eggs around
And they drop their daughters down at the roller rink
Well you're probably standin' there
With your slicked-back Brylcreem hair
Your Lucky's and your daddy's fine-toothed comb
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone
Crazy Bone 
Crazy Bone 
Well you must have left your wisdom tooth at home
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Blame it on the old Crazy Bone
When the grandkids all are grown
And they put you in a home
And eternity is approachin' fast
Yeah you're half out of your head
And you probably pissed the bed
And you can't see a thing to save your ass
And far across the prairie 
In the local cemetery 
They already got your name carved out in stone
When all them nurses say
"Grandpa why you walk that way?"
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone
Yeah blame it on that old
Crazy Bone 
Crazy Bone 
And everybody in that old folks' home
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone
And everybody in that old folks' home
Yeah blame it on that old Crazy BoneLast night, turned on the TV
Looked out the window
And then pulled down the shades
And I came to the conclusion
My mind cannot be made
She said "Well what're you thinkin'?
I'm just a-wonderin', is it somethin' that I did?"
I said, "It's nothin', just somethin'
I picked up as a kid"
I hear a lot of empty spaces
I see a big hole in you
I feel an outline that traces
An imaginary path back to you
This ain't no ordinary blue
Last night for a split sec
I was a trainwreck
I was a complicated guy
I hope we don't find
This is the last time
We ever say goodbye
The orange moon is risin'
On the horizon
Of the outskirts of my mind
I sat and listened
As it glistened
It said, "Leave the past behind"
I hear a lot of empty spaces
I see a big hole in the view
I feel an outline that traces
An imaginary path back to you
This ain't no ordinary blue
Too cold to hold
Too deep to swim through
Too cold to hold
Too deep to swim through
Last night turned on the TV
Looked out the window
And then pulled down the shadesI ain't got nobody hangin' round my doorstep
Ain't got no loose change just a-hangin' round my jeans
If you see somebody, would you send 'em over my way?
I could use some help here with a can of pork and beans
I once had a family, but they up and left me
With nothing but an 8-track, Another Side of George Jones
I was in high cotton just a-bangin' on my six-string
A-kickin' at the trash can, walkin' skin and bone
I can see your back porch, if I close my eyes now
I can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line
I'm thinking it's your business, but you don't got to answer
I'm knockin' on your screen door in the summertime
Everybody's out there climbin' on the trees now
Swingin' in the breeze now, hanging on the vine
I'm dreamin' about a sailboat, I don't need a fur coat
Underneath the dashboard got some sweet potato wine
I can see your back porch, if I close my eyes now
I can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line
I'm thinking it's your business, but you don't got to answer
I'm knockin' on your screen door in the summertime
I'm knockin' on your screen door in the summertimeJesus, the Missing Years
It was raining, it was cold
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve-year old
So he packed his bag and he headed out
To find out what the world's about
He went to France and went to Spain
He found love and he found pain
He found stores, so he started to shop
He had no money, so he got in trouble with a cop
Kids in trouble with the cops from Israel didn't have no home
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome
It was there, he met his Irish bride
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome
Italy, that is
Music publishers, book binders
Bible belters, swimming pools
Orgies, and lots of pretty Italian chicks
Charlie bought some popcorn, Billy bought a car
Someone almost bought the farm, but they didn't go that far
Things shut down at midnight, at least round here they do
'Cause we all reside down the block inside 23 Skidoo
Wine was flowing, so were beers
So Jesus found his missing years
He went to a dance and said, "This don't move me"
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie
On his thirteenth birthday, he saw Rebel Without A Cause
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind
You see, him and the wife wasn't getting along
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song
Called 'The Dove Of Love Fell Off The Perch'
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church
At least not back then, anyhow
Jesus was a good guy
He didn't need this shit
So he took a pill with a Coca-Cola
And he swallowed it
He discovered the Beatles
And he recorded with The Stones
Once he even opened up a three-way package
For old George Jones
Charlie bought some popcorn, Billy bought a car
Someone almost bought the farm, but they didn't go that far
Things shut down at midnight, at least round here they do
'Cause we all reside down the block inside of 23 Skidoo
The years went by like sweet little days
With babies crying pork chops and Beaujolais
When he woke up, he was seventeen
The world was angry, the world was mean
Why, the man down the street and the kid on the stoop
All agreed that life stank, all the world smelled like poop
Baby poop, that is
The worst kind
So he grew his hair long and he threw away his comb
Headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom and Dad and home
But when he got there, the cupboard was bare
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod
He said, "What you gonna be when you grow up?"
Jesus said, "God"
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood
They're gonna kill me, Mama, they don't like me, Bud
So Jesus went to Heaven, he went there awful quick
All them people killed him, he wasn't even sick
So, come and gather around me, my contemporary peers
And I'll tell you all the story of Jesus: The Missing Years
Charlie bought some popcorn, Billy bought a car
Someone almost bought the farm, but they didn't go that far
Things shut down at midnight, at least round here they do
'Cause we all reside down the block inside at 23 SkidooAs the cafe was closing on a warm summer night
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons
The radio played the "Hit Parade"
And I hummed along with the tune
She asked me to change the station
Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me she was trying to blame
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring?
But it's far, far from me
Well, I leaned on my left leg in the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A junebug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why, we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second too long
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring?
But it's far, far from me
Well, I started the engine and I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse
Well, we hadn't gone far in my beat-up old car
And I was prepared for the worst
"Will you still see me tomorrow?"
"No, I got too much to do."
Well, a question ain't really a question
If you know the answer too
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring?
But it's far, far from meYou and me, sittin' in the back of my memory
Like a honeybee buzzing around a glass of sweet Chablis
Radio's on, windows rolled up and my mind's rolled down
Headlights shining like silver moons rollin' on the ground
We made love in every way love can be made
And we made time look like time could never fade
Friday night, we both made the guitar hum
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come
Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end
Gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again
Soul to soul, heart to heart, and cheek to cheek
Now come on, baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down
The promise of your sweet love brings me around
Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end
It's gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again and againWe were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin border
There was this Indian tribe
They found two babies in the woods, white babies
One of them was named Elizabeth
She was the fairer of the two
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie
Having never seen white girls before
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes
They named the larger and more beautiful lake, Lake Elizabeth
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway
Became known forever as Lake Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Many years later, I found myself talking to this girl
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie
The wind was blowing especially through her hair
There was four Italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill
And they was s-s-sizzlin'
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish
Whatever came first
That night, she fell asleep in my arms
Humming the tune to 'Louie Louie'
Aah baby, we gotta go now
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh
The dogs were barking as the cars were parking
The loan sharks were sharking, the narcs were narcing
Practically everyone was there
In the parking lot by the forest preserve
The police had found two bodies
Nay, naked bodies!
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object
Saw it on the news, the TV news in a black and white video
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?
Shadows, shadows! That's what it looks like
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed
Slammed up against the banks of old Lake Marie, Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Standing by peaceful waters
Peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Peaceful waters
Ahh baby, we gotta go nowGod only knows the price that you pay
For the ones you hurt along the way
If I should betray myself today
Then God only knows the price I pay
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows the way that I feel
Is only a part of the way I feel
If I can't reveal the way that I feel
Then God only knows the way I feel
God only knows
God only knows
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows when I'm not true
To the things I say and the things I do
And if I can't be true to the things that I do
Then God only knows the way I feel
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
God only knowsSmall town, bright lights, Saturday night
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feeding daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Bunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young PFC:
There were spaces between Donald and whatever he said
Strangers had forced him to live in his head
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feeding daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Hot love, cold love, no love at all
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
Donald and Lydia made love that night
They made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams
But when they were finished, there was nothing to say
'Cause mostly they made love from ten miles away
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feeding daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heartUp in the morning, work like a dog
Is better than sitting like a bump on a log
Mind all your manners, be quiet as a mouse
Some day you'll own a home that's as big as a house
I know a fella, he eats like a horse
Knocks his old balls round the old golf course
You oughta see his wife, she's a cute little dish
She smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish
There's a big old goofy man
Dancing with a big old goofy girl
Ooh baby, it's a big old goofy world
Elvis had a woman with a head like a rock
I wished I had a woman that made my knees knock
She'd sing like an angel and eat like a bird
And if I wrote a song, she'd know every single word
There's a big old goofy man
Dancing with a big old goofy girl
Ooh baby, it's a big old goofy world
Kiss a little baby, give the world a smile
And if you take an inch, give 'em back a mile
'Cause if you lie like a rug and you don't give a damn
You're never gonna be as happy as a clam
I'm sitting in a hotel trying to write a song
My head is just as empty as the day is long
Why, it's clear as a bell I should have gone to school
I'd be wise as an owl instead of stubborn as a mule
There's a big old goofy man
Dancing with a big old goofy girl
Ooh baby, it's a big old goofy world
Ooh baby, it's a big old goofy worldDear Abby

Dear AbbyAll the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded colors
Are all that's left to linger on
I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs
Memories, they can't be boughten
They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me
Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'
Always look the same to me
I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs
Memories, they can't be boughten
They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from meWanda had a baby in 1951
The father was stranger and a stranger was the son
Call that child James Lewis, call these rooms a home
Changing all them diapers, polish all that chrome
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
All around the schoolyard playing all the games
Running, laughing back and forth, the kid with two first names
Stranger in the closet, lock the diary
The past is running faster, singing harmony
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
"God bless this kitchen" said the knick-knack shelf
"The dinner's almost ready, go and wash yourself"
Jimmy's growing up now and Wanda's growing old
The time is growin' shorter, the nights are long and cold
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
Sneaking in the closet and through the diary
Now, don't you know all he saw was all there was to see
The whole town saw Jimmy on the six o'clock news
His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes
C'mon, baby, spend the night with me
C'mon, baby, spend the night with meWhy must you always seem to criticize me?
Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong
Why don't you come on out and despise me?
So I could pack my bag and, baby, I'd be gone
Remember when you used to call me honey?
Well, I'd turn around and call you honey too
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny
To hurt someone who's so in love with you
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
My body's in this room with you just catching hell
But my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list
But I'm leaning on a jukebox and I'm about halfway there
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer
When you get done talking, I'll come back downstairs
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town
I'm across the river on the other side of town
In my mind I'm going to the dog-racing side of townI have met my love today
I have met my love today
Doesn't really matter what we had to say
I have met my love today
I've been holding on for you
Dreams I've had have all come true
I've seen your picture and I knew you right away
I have met my love today
True love will always have its way
There ain't no doubt about it
True love is here to stay
Day-by-day our love will grow
Day-by-day our love will show
We'll go on forever and I can truly say
I have met my love today
I have met my love todayWell, I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket
For the land of the tall palm tree
Aloha Old Milwaukee, hello Waikiki

AlohaBack before I was a movie star straight off of the farm
I had a picture of another man's wife tattooed on my arm
With a pack of Camel cigarettes in the sleeve of my T-shirt
I'm headin' out to Hollywood just to have my feelings hurt
That town will make you crazy, just give it a little time
You'll be walking 'round in circles down at Hollywood and Vine
You'll be waitin' on a phone call at the wrong end of a broom
Yes, that town'll make you crazy, crazy as a loon
So, I headed down to Nashville to become a country star
Every night you'd find me hangin' at every honky-tonk and bar
Pretty soon I met a woman, pretty soon she done me wrong
Pretty soon my life got sadder than any country song
That town will make you crazy, just give it a little time
You'll be walking round in circles lookin' for that country rhyme
You'll be waitin' on a phone call at the wrong end of a broom
Yea, that town'll make you crazy, crazy as a loon
So I gathered up my savvy, bought myself a business suit
I headed up to New York City where a man can make some loot
I got hired Monday morning, downsized that afternoon
Overcome with grief that evening, now I'm crazy as a loon
So I'm up here in the North Woods just staring at a lake
Wondering just exactly how much they think a man can take
I eat fish to pass the time away neath this blue Canadian moon
This old world has made me crazy, crazy as a loon
Lord, this world will make you crazy, crazy as a loonA young man from a small town

Lay alone in his room with his radio on
Looking for another station

Gave way to the sound below

A Mocca man in a wigwam sitting on a Reservation
With a big black hole in the belly of his soul
Waiting on an explanation
While the white man sits on his fat can
And takes pictures of the Navajo
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics
He steals a little bit of soul

A young man from a small town
With a very large imagination...From the bells of St Mary
To the Count of Monte Cristo
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
The sins of Memphisto
Sally used to play with her hula hoops
Now she tells her problems to therapy groups
Grandpa's on the front lawn staring at a rake
Wondering if his marriage was a terrible mistake
I'm sitting on the front steps drinking Orange Crush
Wondering if it's possible for me to still blush
Uh huh, oh yeah
A boy on a bike with corduroy slacks
Sleeps in the river by the railroad tracks
He waits for the whistle on the train to scream
So he can close his eyes and begin to dream
Uh huh, oh yeah
From the bells of St Mary
To the Count of Monte Cristo
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
The sins of Memphisto
The hands on his watch spin slowly around
With his mind on a bus that goes all over town
Looking at the babies and the factories
And listening to the music of Mister Squeeze
As if by magic or remote control
He finds a piece of a puzzle that he missed in his soul
Uh huh, oh yeah
From the bells of St Mary
To the Count of Monte Cristo
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
The sins of Memphisto
Adam and Eve and Lucy and Ricky
Bit the big apple and got a little sticky
Esmeralda and the Hunchback of Notre Dame
They humped each other like they had no shame
They paused as they posed for a Polaroid photo
She whispered in his ear, "Exactly-Odo Quasimodo"
From the bells of St Mary

Nothing can stop
Nothing can stop
The sins of Memphisto
Sally used to play with her hula hoops
Now she tells her problems to therapy groups
Uh huh, oh yeahA man came to our house
I believe it was yesterday
I would have invited him in
But I didn't have a lot to say
His anticipation of me opening the door
Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before
And drove my concentration
Right through that hardwood floor
I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm taking a walk
I'm just getting by
There's a girl in the White House
I don't even know her name
Her disheveled appearance
Speaks volumes of shame
It's an embarrassing situation
But a situation just the same
The way she walks on others
And never takes the blame
Upsets my constitution
Beyond its mortal frame
I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm watching the birds
I'm just getting by
Found a card in the pocket
Of my worn-out overalls
From a girl in Cedar Rapids
Now residing in Idaho Falls
I wish you could have been there
When she opened up the door
And looked me in the face
Like she never did before
I felt about as welcome
As a Wal-Mart Superstore
I'm taking a walk
I'm going outside
I'm taking a walk
I don't need a ride
I'm watching the birds
Flying so highGrandpa wore his suit to dinner
Nearly every day
No particular reason
He just dressed that way
Brown necktie and a matching vest
And both his wingtip shoes
He built a closet on our back porch
And put a penny in a burned-out fuse
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the war
Well, he used to sing me "Blood on the Saddle"
And rock me on his knee
And let me listen to the radio
Before we got TV
Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday
And he'd take me with him too
Stained glass in every window
Hearing aid in every pew
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the war
Now my grandma was a teacher
Went to school in Bowling Green
Traded in a milking cow
For a Singer sewing machine
Well, he called her husband "Mister"
And she walked real tall in pride
And used to buy me comic books
After Grandpa died
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the warIn an Appalachian Greyhound station
She sits there waiting in a family way
"Goodbye brother, tell Mom I love her
Tell all the others I'll write someday"
From a teenage lover to an unwed mother
Kept undercover like some bad dream
While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered
They run like water through a mountain stream
In a cold and gray town, a nurse says, "Lay down
This ain't no playground and this ain't home"
Someone's children out having children
In a gray stone building all alone
From a teenage lover to an unwed mother
Kept undercover like some bad dream
While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered
They run like water through a mountain stream
On somewhere else bound, Smoky Mountain Greyhound
She bows her head down, hummin' lullabies
Your daddy never meant to hurt you ever
He just don't live here, but you've got his eyes
From a teenage lover to an unwed mother
Kept undercover like some bad dream
While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered
They run like water through a mountain stream
Well, they run like water through a mountain streamThe movie wasn't really doing so hot
Said the new producer to the old big shot
It's dying on the edge of the great Midwest
Sabu must tour or forever rest
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
His manager sat in the office alone
Staring at the numbers on the telephone
Wondering how a man could send a child actor
To visit in the land of the wind chill factor
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
Sabu was sad, the whole tour stunk
The airlines lost the elephant's trunk
The roadie got the rabies and the scabies and the flu
They was low on morale, but they was high on...
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
From the jungles of East St. Paul
From the jungles of East St. PaulI knew a girl who was almost a lady
She had a way with all the men in her life
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty
And she was born on the Fourth of July
Well, she lived in an aluminum house trailer
And she worked in a jukebox saloon
And she spent all the money that I give her
Just to see the old man in the moon
I used to sleep at the foot of Old Glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise
Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings
To the drive-in on Route 41
And it was there that I first suspected
That she was doin' what she'd already done
She said, "Johnny, won't you get me some popcorn"
And she knew I had to walk pretty far
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight
She hopped into a foreign sports car
I used to sleep at the foot of Old Glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise
Well, you know I could have beat up that fellow
But it was her that had hopped into his car
Many times I'd fought to protect her
But this time she was goin' too far
Now some folks, they call me a coward
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night
But I'd druther have names thrown at me
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right
I used to sleep at the foot of Old Glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise
Now she writes all the fellows love letters
Saying "Greetings, come and see me real soon"
And they go and line up in the barroom
And spend the night in that sick woman's room
But sometimes I get awful lonesome
And I wish she was my girl instead
But she won't let me live with her
And she makes me live in my head
I used to sleep at the foot of Old Glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromiseToday I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
I bronzed my shoes and I hung 'em from a rearview mirror
Bronzed admiration in a blind spot of regret
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, scratched my head and I lit my cigarette
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Hey, how lucky can one man get?
Hey, how lucky can one man get?It was Christmas in prison
And the food was real good
We had turkey and pistols
Carved out of wood
And I dream of her always
Even when I don't dream
Her name's on my tongue
And her blood's in my stream
Wait awhile, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me
Come to me now
We're rolling, my sweetheart
We're flowing, by God!
She reminds me of a chess game
With someone I admire
Or a picnic in the rain
After a prairie fire
Her heart is as big
As this whole goddamn jail
And she's sweeter than saccharin
At a drug store sale
Wait awhile, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me
Come to me now
We're rolling, my sweetheart
We're flowing, by God!
The searchlight in the big yard
Swings round with the gun
And spotlights the snowflakes
Like the dust in the sun
It's Christmas in prison
There'll be music tonight
I'll probably get homesick
I love you, goodnight
Wait awhile, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me
Come to me now
We're rolling, my sweetheart
We're flowing, by God!Clocks and spoons and empty rooms, it's raining out tonight
What a way to end a day by turnin' out the light
Shoot the moon right between the eyes
I'm sending most of me to sunny countryside
Runnin' through sky of blue, rollin' in the sun
Every day has a way of overflowing one
Shoot the moon right between the eyes
I'm keeping most of me in sunny countryside
Don't know how I did that now, wonder where it's gone
Must have spent the way I went waitin' for the dawn
Shoot the moon right between the eyes
I'm screaming take me back to sunny countryside
Shoot the moon right between the eyes
I'm screaming take me back to sunny countryside
Clocks and spoons and empty rooms, it's raining out tonightThe rain came down on a tin roof
Hardly a sound was left from the birthday party
The kitchen light fell asleep on a bedroom floor
Me and her were talking softer
Than all the time before I lost her
Picture sat on top of the chest of drawers
One red rose in the Bible
Pressed between the Holy alphabet
Probably wouldn't believe you, if you told me
But what I never knew, I never will forget
Rainy nights get dark real early
Her dress was soft, her hair was curly
We danced around the table to the old banjo
Rainy nights were made for lovers
We lay there still beneath the covers
And I ain't never felt like that before
One red rose in the Bible
Pressed between the Holy alphabet
Probably wouldn't believe you, if you told me
But what I never knew, I never will forgetStrolling down the highway with my shoes in my hand
I don't talk much, I'm a quiet man
Beauty and silence both run deep
And I'm running like crazy while you are asleep
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
Last Monday night, I saw a fight
Between Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night
Tuesday asked me what was going on
I said, "Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn"
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
Hocus-pocus, maladjusted
Don't you think my tears get rusted?
Steady losing means you ain't using
What you really think is right
You got news for me
I got nothing for you
Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet man
Oodles of light, what a beautiful sight
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight
Rays and beams of incredible dreams
And I am a quiet manLast night I saw an accident
On the corner of Third and Green
Two cars collided and I got excited
Just being part of that scene
It was Mrs. Tom Walker and her beautiful daughter
Pamela was driving the car
They got hit by a man in a light blue sedan
Who had obviously been to a bar
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority
It was a four-way stop dilemma
We all arrived the same time
I yielded to the man to the right of me
And he yielded it right back to mine
Well, the yield went around and around and around
Till Pamela finally tried
Just then the man in the light blue sedan
Hit Pamela's passenger side
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority
Pamela hit her head on the mirror
Mrs. Walker got a bump on the knee
The man hit himself in the face and said
"Why does this happen to me?"
Then the neighbors came out and they gathered about
Saying, "Hey, who hit who anyway?"
And the police arrived at a quarter to five
And pronounced all the victims okay
But they don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minorityIt got so hot last night, I swear
You couldn't hardly breathe
Heat lightning burned the sky like alcohol
I sat on the porch without my shoes
And I watched the cars roll by
As the headlights raced to the corner of the kitchen wall
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My God! I cried, it's so hot inside
You could die in the living room
Take the fan from the window, prop the door back with a broom
The cuckoo clock has died of shock
And the windows feel no pain
The air's as still as the throttle on a funeral train
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My father died on the porch outside
On an August afternoon, I sipped bourbon and cried
With a friend by the light of the moon
So it's hurry! hurry! Step right up
It's a matter of life or death
The sun is going down and the moon is just holding its breath
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican homeEverything is cool
Everything's okay
Why, just before last Christmas
My baby went away
Across the sea to an island
While the bridges brightly burn
So far away from my land
The valley of the unconcerned
I was walking down the road, man
Just looking at my shoes
When God sent me an angel
Just to chase away my blues
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds
Just flying thru the sky
And they seemed to form a teardrop
From a black-haired angel's eye
And that tear fell all around me
And it washed my sins away
Now everything is cool
Everything's okay
Everything is cool
Everything's okay
Why, just before last Christmas
My baby went away
And I find it real surprising
For myself to hear me say
That everything is cool
Everything's okay
Everything is cool
Everything's okay
Why, just before last Christmas
My baby went awayThere was a time when lonely men
Would wander through this land rolling aimlessly along
So many times, I've heard of their sad stories
Written in the words of dead men's songs
Down through the years, many men have yearned for freedom
Some found it only on the open road
So many tears of blood have fell around us
'Cause you can't always do what you are told
Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad track
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack?
Last Sunday night, I wrote a letter to my loved ones
I signed my name and knew I'd stayed away too long
There was a time when my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing this hobo song
Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad track
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack?
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sackForty-five minutes, fifty-five cents
Sixty-five agents sitting on a fence
Saying, hey little brother
Look what we got for you
We're gonna rope off an area and put on a show
From the Canadian border down to Mexico
It might be the most potentially gross thing
That we could possibly do
Yeah, little buddy, gonna get your chance
Make them pubescents all wet their pants
We'll record it live and that's no jive
Hold it, stop it, no, no, no, no
Bang went the pistol, crash went the window
Ouch went the son of a gun
Onomatopoeia, I don't wanna see ya
Speaking in a foreign tongue
Knock, knock, hello, can I come in?
Gee, it was a wonderful show
Oh, you haven't gone on yet?
Well, how was I supposed to know?
Hey we got a great date, it's really downtown
We're gonna get the Grand Canyon to do the sound
It's a boxing ring, but it might be the thing
To really put you in the dough
Well listen little brother, don't you get us wrong
Why, we even know one of the words to your song
Just say I do and we'll lay it on you
You, you, and me, me, me, me
Bang went the pistol, crash went the window
Ouch went the son of a gun
Onomatopoeia, I don't want to see ya
Speaking in a foreign tongue
Hey little buddy, gonna get your chance
Make them pubescents all wet their pants
We'll record it live and that's no jive
Hold it, stop it, no, no, no, no

Well I thought she'd never leave
Heaven knows
You know it sure gives me the creeps
Well, I went and loved that woman
To the power of height
And we both got jivin' fever
Screwed our heads uptight
Then it came to blows
Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Hey there she goes
Just a walkin' down the street
I suppose
The next fellow that she meets
Should have her head examined
By an x-ray machine
So he can see all of those pictures
That I've already seen
Just so he knows
Hey hey hey, there she goes
There she goes
Well, there must be something somewhere
That makes me want to hurt myself inside
Yeah, we were a regular Dr. Jekyll
But together, we were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
What a rough rough ride
Hey, there she goes
She's walking out on me
With all her clothes
Lookin' fine as she could be
Well, I seen her on down at the courthouse
I was sober as a judge
We'd tried to talk things over
But the grudge wouldn't budge
I said adios
Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Well, there must be something somewhere
That makes me want to hurt myself inside
Yeah, we were a regular Dr. Jekyll
But together, we were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
What a rough rough ride

Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Yea, there she goes
Hey, there she goesThe station was empty, the trains were all gone
I reached in my pocket and I waited for dawn
The clock played drums and I hummed the sax
And the wind whistled down the railroad tracks
Hey three for a quarter, one for a dime
I'll bet it's tomorrow by Rocky Mountain Time
I walked in the restaurant for something to do
The waitress yelled at me and so did the food
And the water tastes funny when you're far from your home
But it's only the thirsty that hunger to roam
And the clock played drums and I hummed the sax
And the wind whistled down the railroad tracks
Hey three for a quarter, one for a dime
I'll bet it's tomorrow by Rocky Mountain Time
We'll build us a castle on Main Street
And pretend that we're down on the farm
Hell, we'll hold out as long as we have to
Then we'll twist off each other's arm
Christ, I'm so mixed up and lonely
Can't even make friends with my brain
I'm too young to be where I'm going
But I'm too old to go back again
The station was empty, the trains were all gone
I reached in my pocket and I waited for dawn
The clock played drums and I hummed the sax
And the wind whistled down the railroad tracks
Hey three for a quarter, one for a dime
I'll bet it's tomorrow by Rocky Mountain Time
By Rocky Mountain Time
By Rocky Mountain Time
By Rocky Mountain Time
By Rocky Mountain TimeYou can't live together, you can't live alone
Considering the weather
Oh my, how you've grown
From the men in the factories
To the wild kangaroo
Like those birds of a feather
They're gathering together
And feeling exactly like you
They got mesmerized by lullabies
And limbo danced in pairs
Please lock that door
It don't make much sense
That common sense
Don't make no sense no more
Just between you and me, it's like pulling
When you ought to be shoving
Like a nun with her head in the oven
Please don't tell me that this really wasn't nothing
One of these days, one of these nights
You'll take off your hat and they'll read you your rights
You'll wanna get high every time you feel low
Hey, Queen Isabella, stay away from that fellow
He'll just get you into trouble, you know?
But they came here by boats and they came here by plane
They blistered their hands and they burned out their brain
All dreaming a dream that'll never come true
Hey, don't give me no trouble or I'll call up my double
We'll play piggy-in-the-middle with you
You'll get mesmerized by alibis
And limbo dance in pairs
Please lock that door
It don't make much sense
That common sense
Don't make no sense no moreWhile out sailing on the ocean
While out sailing on the sea
I bumped into the Savior
And He said, "Pardon me"
I said, "Jesus, you look tired"
He said, "Jesus, so do you
Won't you sit down, son
'Cause I got some fat to chew?"
See, everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Well he spoke to me of morality
Starvation, pain, and sin
Matter of fact the whole dang time
I only got a few words in
But I won't squawk, let him talk
Hell, it's been a long long time
And any friend that's been turned down
Is bound to be a friend of mine
'Cause everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Pick it!
Now we sat there for an hour or two
Just a-eatin' that Gospel pie
When around the bend come a terrible wind
And lightning lit the sky
He said, "So long, son, I gotta run
I appreciate you listening to me"
And I believe I heard him sing these words
As he skipped out across the sea
Hey everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Someone to open up their ears
And let that trouble through
Now you don't have to sympathize
Or care what they may do
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to
Everybody needs somebody that they can talk toHer father was a failure, her mother was a comfort
To a doctor and a lawyer and an Indian Chief
The shirt ran out of buttons
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game
And they went on relief
The bank took away their diplomas
They locked them up inside of the chest
And she moved away to Oklahoma
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast
God-damn, my thoughts are still hard from lying on the sofa
On the night she was over in my backyard
Yeah, we was shooting the breeze out amongst the trees
When a shot rang low
And left her standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Father, have mercy, get her a nurse please
She's almost alone
I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone
We'd rather see her locked up inside a home
Than see her standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind
Yonder comes a truck, it's drove by two men
Shotgun man leaned out and said
Do you want to take a ride out in the pale moonlight light light light?"
Too long in the hot sun
She could've been Miss Wisconsin a long time ago
Spent too much time inside of the early show
We'd have bought her a ticket, but she didn't want to go
She was standing down by the side of the road
Down by the side of the road
Headlights flashing caught a skirt in the wind
Yonder comes a truck, drove by two men
Shotgun man leaned out and said
"Do you want to take a ride out into the pale moonlight?"
Her father was a failure, her Mother was a comfort

You must be daddy's little pumpkin

Well, it's quarter past eleven
And you're sleeping on the bedroom floor
I can see the fire burning
Burning right behind your eyes
I can see the fire burning
Baby, burning right behind your eyes
You must have swallowed a candle
Or some other kind of surprise
I'm going down to Memphis
Got three hundred dollars in cash
Yeah, I'm going down to Memphis
Got three hundred dollars in cash
All the women in Memphis
Gonna see how long my money will last
Well, I'm going downtown
Gonna rattle somebody's cage
Yeah, I'm going downtown
I'm gonna rattle somebody's cage
I'm gonna beat on my guitar
And strut all around the stage
If you see my baby coming
Don't you tell her that her daddy's in jail
If you see my baby coming
Don't tell her that her daddy's in jail
She'd sell her little pumpkin
Just to raise her sweet daddy's bail
You must be daddy's little pumpkin
I can tell by the way you roll
You must be daddy's little pumpkin
I can tell by the way you roll
Well, you never do nothing
To save your doggone soulI don't want your big french fry, I don't want your car
I don't want to buy no soap from no washed-up movie star
You are so much louder than the show I wanna hear
With your sugarless gum, "gee, but I'm dumb" non-alcoholic beer
It's enough to make a grown man blow up his own TV
Quit hollerin' at me, quit hollerin' at me
I heard you the first time, I heard myself say
Seems like the little woman is getting bigger every day
You don't have to tell the neighbors, a little silence ain't no sin
They already think my name is "where in the hell you been?"
Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder constantly
Quit hollerin' at me, quit hollerin' at me
Whoa oh whoa oh sweet serenity
Whoa oh whoa oh quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me
Ain't it great at the end of the day when there ain't no sound around?
Just me and the fence post staring each other down
Nothing but a big bunch of nothing driving me insane
'Cause there ain't no voice that's louder than the one inside my brain
Hey you go on, go on and let me be
Quit hollerin' at me, quit hollerin' at me
Whoa oh whoa oh sweet Serenity
Whoa oh whoa oh quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me, quit hollerin' at me
Quit hollerin' at me, quit hollerin' at meTime was once just a clock to me
And life was just a book, a biography
Success was something you just had to be
And I would spend myself unknowingly
And you know that I could have me a million more friends
And all I'd have to lose is my point of view
But I had no idea what a good time would cost
Till last night when I sat and talked with you
An apple will spoil if it's been abused
A candle disappears when it has been used
A rainbow may follow up a hurricane
And I can't leave forever on a train
But you know that I'd survive if I never spoke again
And all I'd have to lose is my vanity
But I had no idea what a good time would cost
Till last night when you sat and talked with me
You can smile for the lack of something else to do
And no one will laugh and point at you
If your tears didn't always make me feel so bad
Would you still cry every time that you felt sad?
I thought I'd heard and seen enough to get along
Till you said something neither of us knew
And I had no idea what a good time would cost
Till last night when I sat and talked with youI can taste your lipstick in the wine
I can feel your heartbeat close to mine
With your love wrapped around me
I'm silent and still I know that this love is real
I've tasted other lips I thought were true
I have looked into the eyes I thought were you
Now touching just to touch and feeling just to feel
I know that this love is real
Someone should tell our dreams when love is gone
While still in slumber, memories linger on
Sometimes I lie awake in bed till dawn
Thinking of you, now you're gone
Tender is the heart that sleeps in rest
Tender is the hope of tenderness
Love thy neighbor as thyself and thou shall not steal
I know that this love is real
Love thy neighbor as thyself and thou shall not steal
I know that this love is realJehosaphat the mongrel cat
Jumped off the roof today
Some would say he fell, but I could tell
He did himself away
His eyes weren't bright like they were the night
We played checkers on the train
God bless his soul, he was a tootsie roll
But he's a dead cat just the same
We are living in the future
I'll tell you how I know
I read it in the paper
Fifteen years ago
We're all driving rocket ships
And talking with our minds
And wearing turquoise jewelry
And standing in soup lines
We are standing in soup lines
Jake the barber's lonely daughter
Went down to her daddy's shop
She plugged herself to the barber pole
And took a little off the top
There was pressure on the left, pressure on the right
Pressure in the middle of the hole
I'm goin' to Maine on a forty-foot crane
I'm gonna use it for a fishin' pole
We are living in the future
I'll tell you how I know

Down at the all night picture show
Where they grind out sex
And they rate it with an "X"
Just to make a young man's pants grow
No tops, no bottoms, just hands and feet
Screaming the posters out on the street
Strangling the curious and the weak
We give 'em what they want to see-o
Give 'em what they want to see
We are living in the future
I'll tell you how I know
I read it in the paper
Fifteen years ago
We're all driving rocket ships
And talking with our minds
And wearing turquoise jewelry
And standing in soup lines
We are standing in soup linesI wake up to a clock that's ringing
Birds are singing on my telephone line
I work all day and I chase my woman
Why don't she chase me sometime?
Everybody wants to be wanted
I mean I ain't no scarecrow cop
I don't need no trantalization
I don't need no diddley bop
Next time tell me that you want me
Put your little foot inside of my shoe
Next time tell me that you need me
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
I used to love you so hard in the morning
I'd make you stutter and roll your eyes
I put your mind on a brief vacation
To the land of the lost surprise
Next time tell me that you want me
Put your little foot inside of my shoe
Next time tell me that you need me
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
You got a heart that beats like mine, love
You got a bell that rings so true
I get this feeling that I got to tiptoe
Round every little thing you do
Next time tell me that you want me
Put your little foot inside of my shoe
Next time tell me that you need me
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
Everybody wants to feel like you
Like you
Like youI'm a-walkin' down the street like Lucky Larue
Got my hand in my pocket, thinkin' 'bout you
I ain't hurtin' nobody, I ain't hurtin' no one
There's three hundred men in the state of Tennessee
They're waiting to die, they won't never be free
I ain't hurtin' nobody, I ain't hurtin' no one
Six million seven hundred thousand and thirty three lights on
You think someone could take the time to sit down
And listen to the words of my song
At the beach in Indiana, I was nine years old
Heard Little Richard singing 'Tutti Frutti'
From the top of a telephone pole
I wasn't hurtin' nobody, I wasn't hurtin' no one
There's roosters laying chickens and chickens layin' eggs
Farm machinery eating people's arms and legs
I ain't hurtin' nobody, I ain't hurtin' no one
Perfectly crafted popular hit songs
Never use the wrong rhyme
You'd think that waitress could get my order right the first time
She's sitting on the back steps just shucking that corn
That gal's been grinning since the day she was born
She ain't hurtin' nobody, she ain't hurtin' no one
I used to live in Chicago where the cold wind blows
I delivered more junk mail than the junkyard would hold
I wasn't hurtin' nobody, I wasn't hurtin' no one
You can fool some of the people part of the time
In a rock and roll song
Fifty million Elvis Presley fans can't be all wrong
I'm a-walkin' down the street like Lucky Larue
Got my hand in my pocket, baby, thinkin' 'bout you
I ain't hurtin' nobody, I ain't hurtin' no one
I ain't hurtin' nobody, I ain't hurtin' no one
Hurtin' nobody, hurtin' no one
Hurtin' nobody, hurtin' no one
Hurtin' nobody, hurtin' no oneBy a fountain back in Rome, I fell in love with you
In a small cafe in Athens, you said you loved me too
And it was April in Paris when I first held you close to me
Rome, Georgia, Athens, Texas and Paris, Tennessee
No, we're not the jet set
We're the old Chevro-let set
There's no Riviera
In Festus, Missour-uh
And you won't find Onassis
In Mullinville, Kansas
No, we're not the jet set
We're the old Chevro-let set
But ain't we got love
No, we're not the jet set
We're the old Chevro-let set
Our steak and martinis
Is draft beer with weenies
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky
Is Haggard and Husky
No, we're not the jet set
We're the old Chevro-let set
But ain't we got love
No, We're not the jet set
We're the old Chevro-let set
The Prine and DeMent set
Ain't the flaming suzette set
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky
Is Haggard and Husky
We're the old Chevro-let set
But ain't we got loveEvening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness
Everyday I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we
Shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness
A million years it seems
Have gone by since we
Shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then
Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happinessLeaves were falling just like embers
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire
Burning just like a moonbeam in our eyes
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
I am guilty of something
I hope you never do because there is nothing
Sadder than losing yourself in love
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
Now you ask me just to leave you
To go out on my own and get what I need to
You want me to find what I've already had
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the blues
Somebody said they saw me swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud killing the bluesWhile window shopping through the past
I ran across a looking glass
Reflecting moments remaining in a burned-out light
Tragic magic prayers of passion
Stay the same through changing fashion
They freeze my mind like water on a winter's night
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye, nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
Photographs show the laughs
Recorded in between the bad times
Happy sailors dancing on a sinking ship
Cloudy skies and dead fruit flies
Waving goodbye with tears in my eyes
Well, sure I made it, but you know it was as hell of a trip
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
And ten times what it grieves you
That's how much more I hate to leave you now
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
Spent most of my youth out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye, nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback bluesNight is falling, we're doing the things we do
You are acting just like me, I'm acting just like you
Do you remember when you were my friend?
That's the way I'd like things, just like way back then
Baby's sleeping, brother is on the run
I am out undoing all the good I've done
If you loved me, tell you what I would do
Wrap the world in silver foil, bring it home to you
Lately I feel that I can't pretend
I may never ever see the likes of you again
I take a walk, I come back home, then I sit a spell
Watch the ponies dance around the empty wishing well
Night has fallen, I've said the things I did
The only baby sleeping is when I was a kid
Do you remember when you were my friend?
That's the way I'd like things, just like way back thenIs there ever enough space between us
To keep us both honest and true?
Why is it so hard just to sit in the yard
And stare at the sky so blue?
I've got a new way of walking and a new way of talking
Honey, when I'm around you
But it gives me the blues when I've got some good news
And you're not there to bring it to
Life is a blessing, it's a delicatessen
Of all the little favors you do
All wrapped up together no matter the weather
Baby, you always come through
It's a measure of treasure that gives me the pleasure
Of loving you the way I do
And you know I would gladly say I need your love badly
And bring these little things to you
'Cause you got gold gold inside of you
You got gold gold inside of you
Well I got some gold inside me too
Well I'm thinking I'm knowing that I gotta be going
You know I hate to say 'so long'
It gives me an ocean of mixed up emotion
I'll have to work it out in a song
Well I'm leaving a lot for the little I got
But you know a lot a little will do
And if you give me your love, I'll let it shine up above
And light my way back home to you
'Cause you got gold gold inside of you
You got gold gold inside of you
Well I got some gold inside me too
You got wheels turning inside of you
You got wheels turning inside of you
Well I got wheels turning inside me tooThe last time that I saw her
She was standing in the rain
With her overcoat under her arm
Leaning on a horsehead cane
She said, "Carl, take all the money"
She called everybody Carl
My spirit's broke, my mind's a joke
And getting up's real hard
Don't you know her when you see her?
She grew up in your backyard
Come back to us
Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard
Selling bibles at the airports
Buying Quaaludes on the phone
Hey, you talk about a paper route
She's a shut-in without a home
God save her, please, she's nailed her knees
To some drugstore parking lot
Hey, Mr. Brown, turn the volume down
I believe this evening's shot
Don't you know her when you see her?
She grew up in your backyard
Come back to us
Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard
Can't you picture her next Thursday?
Can you picture her at all
In the Hotel Boulderado at the dark end of the hall?
I gotta shake myself and wonder why she even bothers me
For if heartaches were commercials, we'd all be on TV
Don't you know her when you see her?
She grew up in your backyard
Come back to us
Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna BeauregardThings got rough
Things got tough
Things got harder than hard
We were just trying to make a livin' in our backyard
We were born too late, died to soon
Anxiety's a terrible crime
If you don't come now, don't come at all
'Cause it's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
Yesterday morning an ill wind came
Blew your picture right out of the picture frame
Even blew the candle out from underneath the flame
Yesterday morning an ill wind came
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
Things got rough
Things got tough
Things got harder than hard
We were just trying to make a livin' in our backyard
We were born too late, died to soon
Anxiety's a terrible crime
If you don't come now, don't come at all
'Cause it's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of timeI don't care if the sun don't shine
But it better or people will wonder
No matter if it ever quits rainin'
Except the kids are afraid of the thunder
Say sour grapes
You can laugh and stare
Say sour grapes
But I don't care
I couldn't care less if I didn't have a friend
Except people would say I was crazy
I wouldn't work 'cause I don't need money
Except the same folks would say I was lazy
Say sour grapes
You can laugh and stare
Say sour grapes
But I don't care
I couldn't care less if she never come back
I was gonna leave her anyway
And all the good times that we shared
Don't mean a thing today
Say sour grapes
You can laugh and stare
Say sour grapes
But I don't careIf you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
I know who I'll give it to
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
Anymore
If you don't want the thrill
If you don't want the thrill
If you don't want the thrill
I know who, I know who will
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
Anymore
If that's the way that the world goes round
Then that's the way that it all comes down
When you want me, I won't be around
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
I know who I'll give it to
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
If you don't want my love
AnymoreFeelings are strange especially when they come true
And I had a feeling that you'd be leaving soon
So I tried to rearrange all my emotions
But it seems the same, no matter what I do
Blue umbrella, rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain while the rain makes up my mind
Well, my feet are wet from thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you anymore
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other four
Day time makes me wonder why you left me
Night time makes me wonder what I said
'Next time' are the words I'd like to plan on
But 'last time' was the only thing you said
Blue umbrella, rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain while the rain makes up my mind
Well, my feet are wet from thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you anymore
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other fourI've been down this road before, I remember every tree
Every single blade of grass, holdsâ€…aâ€…special place forâ€…me
And I remember every town, everyâ€…hotel room
Every song I ever sang on a guitar out of tune
I remember everything, things I can't forget
The way you turned and smiled on me on the night that we first met
And I remember every night your ocean eyes of blue
I miss you in the morning light like roses miss the dew
I've been down this road before alone as I can be
Careful not to let my past go sneakin' up on me
Got no future in my happiness, the regrets are very few
Sometimes a little tenderness was the best that I could do
I remember everything, things I can't forget
Swimin' pools of butterflies would slip right through the net
And I remember every night your ocean eyes of blue
I miss you in the morning light like roses miss the dew
I miss you in the morning light like roses miss the dewI take too much abuse from you
That's all I ever get
Yeah callin' a man like you a husband
Is just like callin' a wild cat a pet
You'd better stop your runnin' around
Say nothin', start movin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone?
Each day you walk all over me
Can't you find another route?
If you'd start actin' like a married man
Maybe we could find a way to work things out
You'll find your key won't fit the lock
If you keep on keepin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone?
I know you think I'm a-runnin' round
And that's why you're so peeved
That's another line of the same old stuff
I hope you don't expect me to believe
Go out tonight, but don't come back
'Cause you just lost a home
But who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone?
I know you think I'm a-runnin' round
And that's why you're so peeved
That's another line of the same old stuff
I hope you don't expect me to believe
Go out tonight, but don't come back
'Cause you just lost a home
But who's gonna take that garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone?
Yeah, who's gonna take your garbage out
When I've packed my bags and gone?
You're gonna miss me, honey gal
Are you kiddin' me?
You're gonna miss me and my Hefty bags
Watch me, I'm leavin' now
I'll take that garbage half the way up the drive
You miss me yet?
I'm tryin'Do you like me?
Well, I hope you do
Cause if you like me
Then I think I'm gonna have to like you too
We'll share our things
And have some fun
Then we'll say goodbye
And go back home when the day is done
If you tell me
I'll tell you too
And we'll say the things
And do the things that lovers do
We'll keep it to ourselves
We won't hurt no one
Then we'll say goodbye
And go back home when the day is done
We'll carve our names
On a tree
Then we'll burn it down
So no one in the world will see
And we'll make love
While we watch the flame
Then we'll walk away
As if we never had no shame
Now we must hide
To be alone
And we can't say
Our sweet things on the telephone
If we can't stop
What we've begun
We should say goodbye
And go back home when the day is done
Do you still like me?
Well, I hope you do
'Cause if you still like me
Then I think I'm gonna have to still like you
We shared our things
And had some fun
Now we'll say goodbye
And go back home when the day is done
Yeah, we'll say goodbye
And go back home while
We still have one
Let's say goodbye and go back home
Now the day is done
Songwriters:  John Prine and Gary NicholsonI don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, way too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
Oh, if we have a chance to make one heart of two
Then I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you
Yes, I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I, and so are you
If this was a movie then we're right on cue
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with youThere's a rainbow of babies draped over the graveyard
Where all the dead sailors wait for their brides
And the cold bitter snow has strangled each grass blade
Where the salt from their tears washed out with the tide
And I smiled on the Wabash the last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink from the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep as I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven before he died
Now the harbor is on fire with the dreams and desires
Of a thousand young poets who failed 'cause they tried
For a rhyme without reason floats down to the bottom
Where the scavengers eat 'em and wash in with the tide
And I smiled on the Wabash the last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink from the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep as I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven before he died
The sun can play tricks with your eyes on the highway
The moon can lay sideways till the ocean stands still
But a person can't tell his best friend he loves him
Till time has stopped breathing, you're alone on the hill
And I smiled on the Wabash the last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink from the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep as I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven before he diedFull blown silence in an empty room
A former bride and a former groom
A folding table and a folding chair
A folded hand of poker there
All new directions must go everywhere
Big round people in a cool little square
You can't cut it with a boat or a plane
Man it's gonna take a new train
You'll be leaving on a new train
Far away from this world of pain
And when you look out your window, you'll see
Your home, your baby, and your family
No melted ice cube in a paper cup
Hell, you'll be happy you'll be all shook up
The friends that greet you will be simple and plain
When you step down from that new train
Collected volumes of history say
Man makes mistakes most everyday
The half a pound of chopped ground round
Is still a burger when it goes downtown
No faded photographs of yesterdays
Are in the books that I read these days
To fly away from that memory town
You must keep both your feet on the ground
'Cause you'll be leaving on a new train
Far away from this world of pain
And when you look out your window, you'll see
Your home, your baby, and your family
No melted ice cube in a paper cup
Hell, you'll be happy you'll be all shook up
The friends that greet you will be simple and plain
When you step down from that new train
I'll be leaving on a new train
Far away from this world of pain
The friends that greet me will be simple and plain
When I step down from that new train
New train, new trainShe is my everything
From her suntanned shoulders
Down to the freckles
On her wedding ring
Her feet are so warm
They can melt the snow
In the early spring
She is my everything
She goes everywhere
From Copenhagen
To makin' eggs and bacon
Down in Jackson Square
I'd like to drive a Cadillac
The color of her long black hair
She goes everywhere
Kisses that come all the way from China
Kind of remind her of memories of Spain
If I get lost, you can always find her
Standing right beside me in the rain
She uses Eveready batteries
To keep her electrical appliances going steady
She can do 14 things at once
And then her phone'll ring
She is my everything
She knows everybody
From Muhammad Ali
To teaching Bruce Lee
How to do Karate
She could lead a parade
While puttin' on her shades
In her Maserati
She knows everybody
Kisses that come all the way from China
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain
If I get lost, you can always find her
Standing right beside me in the rain
She is my everything
When she wakes up in the morning
That's when the birdies
Start to sing
When I hear her voice
I'll tell you boys
I forget everything
She is my everything
She is my everythingI can hear the wheels of the automobiles so far away
Just moving along through the drifting snow
It's times like these when the temperatures freeze
I sit alone just looking at the world through a storm window
And down on the beach, the sandman sleeps
Time don't fly, it bounds and leaps
And a country band that plays for keeps
They play it so slow
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby down
Well, the spirits were high till the well went dry
For so long, the raven at my window was only a crow
I bought the rights to the inside fights
And watched a man just beating his hand against a storm window
While miles away o'er hills and streams
A candle burns a witch's dreams
Silence is golden till it screams
Right through your bones
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby down
Storm windows, gee but I'm getting old
Storm windows keep away the cold
Storm windows, gee but I'm getting old
Storm windows keep away the cold
I can hear the wheels of the automobiles so far away
Just moving along through the drifting snow
It's times like these when the temperatures freeze
I sit alone just looking at the world through a storm window
And down on the beach, the sandman sleeps
Time don't fly, it bounds and leaps
And a country music band that plays for keeps
They play it so slow
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby down
Don't let your baby downBlack faces pressed against the glass
Where rain has pressed its weight
Windblown scarves in top-down cars
All share one western trait
Sadness leaks through tear-stained cheeks
From winos to dime-store Jews
Probably don't know they give me
These late John Garfield blues
Midnight fell on Franklin Street
And the lamppost bulbs were broke
For the life of me, I could not see
But I heard a brand new joke
Two men were standing upon a bridge
One jumped and screamed "you lose!"
And just left the odd man holding
Those late John Garfield blues
Old man sleeps with his conscience at night
Young kid sleeps with his dreams
While the mentally ill sit perfectly still
And live through life's in-betweens
I'm going away to the last resort
In a week or two real soon
Where the fish don't bite, but once a night
By the cold light of the moon
The horses scream, the nightmares dream
And the dead men all wear shoes
'Cause everybody's dancing
Those late John Garfield bluesThe sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said, "Sweetheart, remember me"
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now, and we will never
Be the same except in memory
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear
A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end, fairweather friends may break your heart, dear
If they do, sweetheart, remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
Just to know you still remember meHe caught a train from Alexandria, just a broken man in flight
Runnin' scared with his devils, sayin' prayers all through the night
But mercy can't find him, not in the shadows where he calls
Forsaking all his better angels: That's how every empire falls
The bells ring out on Sunday morning like echoes from another time
All our innocence and yearning and sense of wonder left behind
Oh gentle hearts remember, What was that story? Is it lost?
For when religion loses vision, That's how every empire falls
He toasts his wife and all his family, the providence he brought to bear
They raise their glasses in his honor although this union they don't share
A man who lives among them was still a stranger to them all
For when the heart is never open, That's how every empire falls
Padlock the door and board the windows, put the people in the street
"It's just my job," he says, "I'm sorry," and draws a check, goes home to eat
At night he tells his woman, "I know I hide behind the laws"
She says, "You're only taking orders": That's how every empire falls
A bitter wind blows through the country, a hard rain falls on the sea
If terror comes without a warning, there must be something we don't see
What fire begets this fire, like torches thrown into the straw?
If no one asks, then no one answers: That's how every empire fallsOh I get drunk most every night
Seems like all we do is fight
The more I drink, the less I feel blue
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool
Spendin' my life on an old barstool
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
If this date were to be our last
I'd never set down this glass
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you
You've left my heart a vacant lot
I'll fill it with another shot
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
Looks like I had my fill
Guess I better pay my bill
When I started out, I only meant to have a few
Someone just said that you left town
I better get a double round
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after youOh, the glory of true love
Is a wild and precious thing
It don't grow on old magnolias
Or only blossom in the spring
No, the glory of true love
Is it will last your whole life through
Never will go out of fashion
Always will look good on you
You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love
Long before I met you, darlin'
Lord, I thought I had it all
I could have my lunch in London
And my dinner in St. Paul
I got some friends in Albuquerque
Where the governor calls me "Gov"
You can give 'em all to Goodwill
For the glory of true love
You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love
Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love
Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true loveWhile walking out one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we held our show
I heard a little mission band
Playing with all their might
I gave my soul to Jesus
And left the show that night
The day will soon be over
And evening will be gone
No more gems to be gathered
So let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us
And says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining
No longer in the roughFalling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it
Men cluster to me
Like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn
I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it
Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
What am I to do?
I can't help itDim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-lovin' man
A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
I'd rather have a drink with the first guy I meet
And the only home I know is the bar down the street
Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-lovin' man
Drinkin' and a-dancin' to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life I'll ever understand
Go out and have your fun
You think you've played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart
Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home-lovin' man
You'll never make a wife to a home-lovin' manThe motel lights were blinkin'
On my chartreuse four door Lincoln
On the dock, the fish were stinkin'
I simply didn't have a care
And the old men sit 'round the cracker barrels
The children hum their Christmas carols
The train tracks all run parallel
But they'll all meet up one day
On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday
We used to tell each other lies
With our orange plastic button eyes
In a former life on a motel chair
I was Charlie Parker's teddy bear
Yeah, me and Bird, we'd stay up late
I used to watch him contemplate
While his horn would sit by the window and wait
Till it was time for him to blow it
On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday
The only song I ever knew
Was "Moonlight Bay on the Avenue"
These are the tales from the Devil's chin
Charlie, I could've been a contender
And the old men sit around the cracker barrels
The children hum their Christmas carols
The train tracks all run parallel
But they'll all meet up one day
On a dusty pew in a vestibule
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool
He's waiting for the next poor fool
Who forgot that it was Sunday
Who forgot that it was SundayGreat rain great rain, I thought I heard you call my name
Great rain great rain, I thought I heard you call my name
I was standing in the station waving down an unmarked train
There's a fire at the junction, why do you do the things you do?
There's a fire at the junction, why do you do the things you do?
I was praying for mercy and all he ever sent me was you
Jimmy bought the liquor, I bought the cups and ice
Jimmy bought the liquor, honey, I bought the cups and ice
I tell you funny stories, why can't you treat me nice?
Great rain great rain, I thought I heard you call my name
Great rain great rain, I thought I heard you calling my name
I was standing by the river talking to a young Mark TwainDoes he still think about her?
Why, there was never really any doubt
Every time he lights a candle
Or blows a candle out
The scientific nature of the ordinary man
Is to go on out and do the best you can
I don't think that you know
That I think you don't know
That old barometer goes crazy, baby
Every time it starts to snow
You won't find me walking
Around your part of town
Humidity built the snowman
Sunshine brought him down
This world is full of people
They never seem to fall
Somebody said they seen you
You hadn't changed at all
The fundamental story of the contemporary man
Is to walk away and someday understand
I don't think that you know
That I think you don't know
That old barometer goes crazy, baby
Every time it starts to snow
And you won't find me walking
Around your part of town
Humidity built the snowman
Sunshine brought him down
The scientific nature of the ordinary man
Is to go on out and do the best you can
I don't think that you know
That I think you don't know
That old barometer goes crazy, baby
Every time it starts to snow
You won't find me walking
Around your part of town
Humidity built the snowman
Sunshine brought him down
Humidity built the snowman
Sunshine brought him down
Brought him downI'm beginning to like you
But you know that ain't right
'Cause you'll just twist and twist and twist
Till I'm crooked inside
You'll take all you gave me
Like it never was there
And I think that I might, No! I know
Yes, I will help you there
'Cause I've done it before
And I'd do it again
'Cause it's the only time
That makes me feel like I'm my own best friend
I'm a victim of friction, I got too close to see
Yeah, we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me
The lamp gets real heavy, it hangs from my heart
And it comes, and it goes till I can't tell the difference apart
But I've done it before
And I'd do it again
'Cause it's the only time
That makes me feel like I'm my own best friend
So many people say it'll never work out that way
You can't stand the heat while you're watching your heart
Just melt away in a basement on a rainy day
La la la la la la
There's motel in Shreveport, don't ask me where, please
They check in, they check out by the light of the color TV
And the maid calls you honey, she makes your bed slow
And she speaks of the sheets that don't fit, but you know that she knows
I've done it before
And I'd do it again
'Cause it's the only time
That makes me feel like I'm my own best friend
My own best friend
My own best friend
My own best friendI come home from work this evening
There was a note in the frying pan
It said, "fix your own supper, babe
I run off with the Fuller brush man"
And I miss the way she used to yell at me
The way she used to cuss and moan
And if I ever go out and get married again
I'll never leave my wife at home
Well, I sat down at the table
Screamed and I hollered and cried
And I commenced a-carryin' on
Till I almost lost my mind
'Cause I miss the way she used to yell at me
The way she used to cuss and moan
And if I ever go out and get married again
I'll never leave my wife at home
If I ever see another salesman
Come a-knockin' at my door
I'm gonna pick up a rock and hit him on the head
And knock him down on the floor
'Cause I miss the way she used to yell at me
The way she used to cuss and moan
And if I ever go out and get married again
I'll never leave my wife at home
