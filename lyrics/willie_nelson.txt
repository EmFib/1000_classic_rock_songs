Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Desert roads, desert plains
I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more, no more, cruel world
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Dusty trail, saw vapor light
Was it a mirage? I don't know, but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Cruel, cruel world, I'm goneLiving on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down South
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
All the Federales say
We could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
A few gray Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I supposeOn the road again -
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again -
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road againCowboys ain't easy to love
And they're harder to hold
They'd rather give you a song
Than diamonds or gold
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis
And each night begins a new day
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms
And clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies and children
And girls of the night
Them that don't know him
Won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different
But his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they loveMaybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mindIn the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rainLaugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely
If I ever needed you, buddy
You know now I really do, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely
I cry at the least, little thing, buddy
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy
Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely
Let's talk about things as they were, buddy
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy
Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonelyWell, it’s all going to pot

Well I thought I had found me a girl
Sweetest little thing in the world
But all my jokes went up in smoke
When I caught her makin' eyes at Merle
He said, sweet little honey
With her eye on your money

I said she's never gonna get it
Cause I've already spent it
Merle, it's all goin' to pot

When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my father's wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa
My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, she is my wife
She's my grandmother too
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa
Now, if my wife is my grandmother
Then, I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpaWhen you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get throughHe looked down into her brown eyes
And said "Say a prayer for me"
She threw her arms around him
Whispered "God will keep us free"
They could hear the riders coming
He said "This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive"
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, "Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man"
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home
There were seven Spanish angels
At the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped
And the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home
Come on Willie, help me with this thing
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun 
They were praying for the lovers 
In the Valley of the Gun 
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne 
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel homeWhiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
1:42 - 2:13
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold
Whiskey River take my mind 
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
3:02 - 3:30
Whiskey River take my mind
Whiskey River take my mindJust as I am, without one plea
But that thy blood was shed for me
And that thou bidst me come to thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fightings and fears within, without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind
Sight, riches, healing of the mind
Yea, all I need in thee to find
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down
Now, to be thine, yea thine alone
O Lamb of God, I come, I comeAt a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers, and believers, and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go
Well, it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home
And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail, spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy
Well, it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going homeI'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering what in the world did I do?
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving youHello walls , how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company
Hello window , well, I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain
She went away and left us all alone, the way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling , I'm going to stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me a while?
We gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long timeIf you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
That's what Election Day is all about
The biggest gun we've got
Is called "the ballot box"
So if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
Vote 'em out 
Vote 'em out 
And when they're gone, we'll sing and dance and shout
Bring some new ones in
And we'll start that show again
And if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
If it's a bunch of clowns you voted in
Election Day is comin' 'round again
If you don't like it now
If it's more than you'll allow
If you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
Vote 'em out 
Vote 'em out 
And when they're gone, we'll sing and dance and shout
Bring some new ones in
And we'll start the show again
And if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
Vote 'em out 
Vote 'em out 
That's what Election Day is all about
The biggest gun we've got
Is called "the ballot box"
So if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
If you don't like who's in there, well, vote 'em outIt's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul
Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
But if you're staying in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothing in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul
It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul
On a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we're just sitting there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
Well, we drank a lot of whiskey
So I don't know if we went on that night at all
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul
It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and PaulNow Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two
Seemed to know just what to do
Invented the sound that hooked you and me
Added one to make the Tennessee Three
The Man In Black was long and lean
Hit the Billboard charts with a Teenage Queen
Had a television show, the best we'd seen
That chick-a-boom rock really made a splash
Missing ol' Johnny Cash
Well Johnny Cash was a friend of mine
Knew him well for a mighty long time
Shared the stage for many a show
Broke my heart to see him go
Cash had the fire of a thousand men
Lovin' life was his greatest sin
Treated his fans like the next of kin
Rappin' a bit, talkin' trash
Missing ol' Johnny Cash
Well now Johnny Cash wore black attire
And he fell into that Ring of Fire
He came up swinging like a Boy Named Sue
And he married June Carter and he fired Stu
He wrote his songs from deep within
And he hit the stage with a crooked grin
He and I were both Highwaymen
And that record became a smash
Well I'm missing ol' Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash never walked no line
Johnny Cash never did no time, but
When he sang a Folsom Prison Blues
You knew good and well he'd paid his dues
True, he always dressed in black
But he loved folks and they loved him back
Carried his pills in a brown paper sack
Well I don't care if they found his stash
I'm missin' old Johnny Cash
Now is it really true that him and Roy Nichols
Rose Maddox, some people roasted hot dogs
In the back of a limousine with ice cream sticks?
I don't know, I said they set the curtains on fire in an
English hotel room just to warm their hands
Well, Willie, do you know anything about Cash?
Well yeah, I know a lot of things about Cash
I'm not sure I should talk about it
But I checked with John
Asked him if it's OK, he said he didn't give a shit
One time he took a casket up to his hotel room
And got into it and called room service
I thought that was pretty funny
Now Cash had the fire of a thousand men
Lovin life was his greatest sin
Treated his fans like the next of kin
Rappin a bit, talkin trash
Missing ol' Johnny CashWell, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip outYes I understand, that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I’m a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they’ve got none uh-huh
Stay with me ohh
Let’s just breathe
Practiced on my sins, never gonna let you win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don’t want to hurt
There’s so much in this world to make me believe
Stay with me
You're all I see
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh if I didn’t I’m a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh
Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Did I say that I need you? Ohoh
Did I say that I want you?
Oh if I didn’t I’m a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean
Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Love you till I die, meet you on the other sideShotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
Well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't play music if you don't know nothing to play
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
Now, John T. Floores was a-working for the Ku Klux Klan
At six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family thereRoll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving
So don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Now, you won't see no sad and teary eyes
When I get my wings and it's my time to fly
Call my friends and tell 'em
There's a party, come on by
Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving
So don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
When I'd go I've been here long enough
So you'll sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
Just keep the music playing
That'll be a good goodbye
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving
So don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Hey, take me out and build a roaring fire
Roll me in the flames for about an hour
Then take me out and twist me up
And point me towards the sky
And roll me up and smoke me when I die
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving
So don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I dieSometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainLast night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light, I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Well I made up my mind I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape that I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sittin' at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a ten
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you ten to one you have tooIt was the time of the preacher
When the story began
With the choice of a lady
And the love of a man
How he loved her so dearly
He went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
That she'd left behind
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
He went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the preachin' is over
And the lesson's begunLook around you
Look down the bar from you
The lonely faces that you see
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?
These are your friends
But are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?
Please don't let my tears persuade you
I had hoped I wouldn't cry
But lately, teardrops seem a part of me
So look around you
And take a good look
And just between you and me
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny how time slips away?
How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny how time slips away?
I got to go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you
In time, you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips awayBlue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on
I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly by
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now onYou're my buddy, my pal, my friend
It will be that way until the end
And wherever you go, I want you to know
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend
And I've loved you all over the world
You are my sunshine
You keep my life in a whirl
And you love me sometimes
I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the world
I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the worldJim, Jim
I wore a tie today
The first that I ever wore
You have said that I look like a dummy
Out of a dry goods store
Oh, Jim, Jim, the preacher said a lot of things
But I didn't hear a word he said
My mind kept wandering
Back down the trail
Back to the good times we had
Riding herd through the sun and the rain
Panning for gold on the cuff
We did everything in the books, I guess
And a lot that they never thought up
Oh, Jim, Jim, so you're riding on ahead
Well, if that's how it's going to be
When you reach those streets paved with gold
Jim, take a claim out for me
We did everything we could do for ya, Jim
But your fever just wouldn't go down
So we put you on a wagon, Jim
And this morning we got you back to town
But when we got here, you were gone, Jim
And there wasn't anything anybody could do
They dressed you up in a fancy suit and a necktie
And so, today, we wore one too
Riding herd through the sun and the rain
Panning for gold on the cuff
We've did everything in the book I guess
And a lot that they never thought up
Oh Jim, Jim, so you're riding on ahead
Well if that's how its going to be
When you reach those streets paved with gold
Jim, stake a claim out for meCan I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
And I assure you, I'll do you no wrong
Don't know why, but the one I love left me
Left me lonely and cold and so weak
And I need someone's arms to hold me
'Til I'm strong enough to get back on my feet
Can I sleep in your arms?
Can I sleep in your arms?
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrong
Can I sleep in your arms tonight, lady?
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you I'll do you no wrongThe red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again
A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again
The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
"Don't cross him, don't boss him
"He's wild in his sorrow
"He's riding and hiding his pain
"Don't fight him, don't spite him
"Just wait 'til tomorrow
"Maybe he'll ride on again"
The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on againReasons to quit
The smoke and booze don't do me like before
And I'm hardly ever sober
My old friends don't come round much anymore
Reasons to quit
The low is always lower than the high
And the reasons to quit
Don't outnumber all the reasons why
So we keep smokin' and we keep drinkin'
Havin' fun and never thinkin'
Laughin' at the price tag that we pay
And we keep roarin' down the fast lane
Like two young men feelin' no pain
And the reason for quittin's gettin' bigger each day
Reasons to quit
I can't afford the habit all the time
I need to be sober
I need to write some new songs that will rhyme
Reasons to quit
They have no rhyme or reason when you're high
And the reasons to quit
Don't outnumber all the reasons why
And we keep smokin', we keep drinkin'
Havin' fun, never thinkin'
Laughin' at the price tag that we pay
And we keep roarin' down the fast lane
Like two young men feelin' no pain
And the reason for quittin's gettin' bigger each day
And the reason for quittin's gettin' bigger each dayTake the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Playing soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the nightThe postman delivered
A "past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And I opened the door on my knee
But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
Because it's the holiday season"
And you fill such a big empty space
But then I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
Because your love makes my life complete
But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for living
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free
But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on meThis ole house once knew his children
This ole house once knew his wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As they fought the storms of life
This old house once rang with laughter
This old house heard many shouts
Now he trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin' walks about
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints
This ole house is a-gettin' shaky
This ole house is a-gettin' old
This ole house lets in the rain
This ole house lets in the cold
On his knees I'm gettin' chilly
But he feel no fear nor pain
'Cause he see an angel peekin'
Through a broken windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints
This ole house is afraid of thunder
This ole house is afraid of storms
This ole house just groans and trembles
When the night wind flings its arms
This ole house is gettin' feeble
This old house is needin' paint
Just like him it's tuckered out
But he's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints
This ole house dog lies a-sleepin'
He don't know I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace
And he'd sit there and howl and grieve
But my huntin' days are over
Ain't gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel done brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saintsI'm a kid with a guitar
Trying to play "Nuages", when they ask
Where does your style come from?
I know what you mean
Because I learned to sing
Listening to "Blue Yodel Number One"
We love Hank and Lefty
Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and Johnny Cash
But if we had to pin point
The start of who we are
Or who we go by
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and Jimmie
Through the twenties and thirties
Jimmie sang his way to the top
In spite of those old "TB Blues"
Django was a star
He burned up a guitar
With just two good fingers to use
You can't turn back time
Or put more sand in the glass
But sometimes at night
I close my eyes and go back
The Django and Jimmie
Has Mississippi
A young singing brakeman
A jazz playing gypsy
Might not have been
A Merle or a Willie
If not for a Django and JimmieThe only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Songwriters:  Bobby Emmons and Chips MomanWe rode into battle barebacked and saddled
You took the wound in your side
You pulled the sleds and you pulled the wagons
You gave 'em somewhere to hide
Now they don’t need you and there's no one to feed you
And there's fences where you used to roam
I wish I could gather up all of your brothers
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back home
I got a small place  up in the foothills
Where green grass is precious as gold
I paid a fortune for what little I got here
But you know that I’d sell my soul
To have all the mountains, the rivers, and valleys
The places where you need to roam
I would just gather up all of your brothers
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back homeRiding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name
And freight-yards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealing cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels rumbling beneath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good morning America how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues
Good morning America how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is doneWelcome to 2003 minus 25
Oh, say can you smell her for the smoke
God's still up there laughin' so He's gotta be alive
Who says He can't take a dirty joke
Power isn't, power does and power slips away
It's so easy to abuse
Who'd've thought them Arabs would've bought
The USA just to give it to the Jews
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damn when I choose to
And you know that it don't hurt so bad when you're high
Oh, say does the future of the homesick
And the brave even matter anymore
There ain't no more reason for them boys
To run away than there was to fight before
Would you tell me why the hell we'd try to win back in a war
What we wasted in the last?
Might just ain't as righteous as it used to be before
When your army's out of gas
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damn when I choose to
And you know that it don't hurt so bad when you're high
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damnI'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even with you
'Cause you're leaving
But sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this yearNow I've been up the Chisholm Trail
Been through Death Valley, hot as hell
I rode across the dusty plains
There's cowboy runnin' through my veins
But I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
Well I've watched the heard from dusk 'til dawn
But I did it with my britches on
You can have a chew, you can bum a smoke
But don't go reachin' for my rope
I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
What you do's your business hoss
You can buy me a beer, and then fuck off
But I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't right 
That shit ain't rightWhy are there so many songs about rainbows?
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
And what's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do you think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one in the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and meI turned the sound down on my TV
I just can't listen any more
It's like I'm in some foreign country
That I've never seen before
So come now here to think about it
What in the hell are we goin to do?
Cause after all is said and all is done
It's just me and you
It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you
I had a friend I used to talk to
We used to both sit on the fence
But anymore I can't relate to him
'Cause he ain't got a lick of sense
So now I just ask you the questions
But I'm the one I'm talkin' to
The world has gone out of its mind
Except for me and you
It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you
Yeah it's just me and youTake back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now, your love was all I was after
I'll make it now, I can get off on you
I can get by on little
Or nothing at all I know
I can get high just thinkin'
About you and so
Well, take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now, your love was all I was after
I'll make it now, I can get off on you
Who would have thought
This was somethin' that I'd ever do
I'm working it out
Mellowing out on you
Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now, your love was all I was after
I'll make it now, I can get off on you
Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now, your love was all I was after
I'll make it now, I can get off on youBut he could not forgive her
Though he tried and tried and tried
And the halls of his memory
Still echo her lies
And he cried like a baby
And he screamed like a panther in the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the lesson is over
And the killin's begunWhen we dance together, my world's in disguise
It's a fairyland tale that's come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms
Waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with you
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
The moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine, dear, I could dance all night long
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms
Waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending, I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas with youGrab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a petter pat
And that happy tune is your step?
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the streetThere's a family Bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one
I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
"Rock of ages
Rock of ages, cleft for me"
Now this old world
Of ours is full of trouble
And this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me
I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for meTime flies by
In the blink of an eye
When you get paid for having too much fun
Kicking out the foot lights
Living the night life
Like tomorrow ain't never going to come
Wouldn't change much of nothing
About this road we've been running
For of wild times, wild women, and a song
But we would've taking much better care of ourselves
If we would have known we would live this long
Whiskey goes down
Like cold, spring water
Over rocks, and the close of the day
When you're flying like Eagles
Down American highways
You lose a lot of friends along the way
But we just keep on moving
And rolling along
Can't look back
We might turn to stone
But we would've taking much better care of ourselves
If we would have known we was gonna live this long
If we would've known we would live this long
We might have changed things up a bit
We still would've lived out every song
Just maybe not quite as fast as we did
But we're in pretty good shape, Will
The shape we're in
We'll keep rocking along, until we're gone
But we would've taking much better care of ourselves
If we would have known we was gonna live this long
Yeah, we would've taking much better care of ourselves
If we would have known we was gonna live this longHave I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told you how with all my heart and soul I need you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream that I dream is you somehow?
And have I told you how my every thought is in your keeping?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
My world would end today if I should lose you
'Cause I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you nowSomewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm
I know it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
I know; shining down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow
I know it can't stop, I wonder
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
Coming down on a sunny day
Coming down on a sunny dayYou told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'til the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and I will never
Be the same, except in memory
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
And it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
Another love with a heart more bold and free
But in the end fair-weather friends may break your heart, dear
And if they do, sweetheart, remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
Just to know you still remember meWe were headed home in Austin
Caught pneumonia on the road
Taking it home to Connie and the kids
A wheel ran off and jumped a railroad
Then ran through a grocery store
If you want to buy a bus I'm taking bids
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
He said traveling on the road is such a drag
If we can make it home by Friday we can brag
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
Well I just got back from New York City
Kris and Rita done it all
Raw perfection there for all the world to see
Lord I heard an angel singing
In the Philharmonic Hall
Rita Coolidge Rita Coolidge cleft for me
And the devil shivered
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bagTwinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
In the dark blue sky, you keep
While you throw my window peep
And you never shut your eye
Till the sun is in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you areGeorgia, Georgia
The whole day through
An' just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mind
On my mindI'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For what good is life without the one you love
I'd trade all of my tomorrows, they're worthless anyway
If my arms can't hold the one I am dreaming of
Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
I'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
I don't want to live without you anyhow
Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
I don't want to live without you anyhowWell, I might have gone fishing, I got to thinking it over
The road to the river is a mighty long way
Well, it must be the season, no rhyme or no reason
I'm taking it easy, it's my lazy day
And never mind calling because I ain't coming
Just get you on by me, stay out of my way, stay out of my way
A little deep thinking could drive me to drinking
Hey, I'm a taking it easy, this lazy day
Well, I might have gone fishing, I got to thinking it over
The road to the river, it's a mighty long way
Must be the season, no rhyme or no reason
I'm taking it easy, it's my lazy dayI know you won't believe these things I tell you
No, you won't believe
Your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
And your mind cannot conceive
Now all depends on what I say to you
And on your doubting me
So I've prepared these statements far from true
Pay heed and disbelieve
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
And the sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
And the sky was never blue
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
And I never cared for you
And I never cared for you
I never cared for youOh, Ellis Island was swarming
Like a scene from a costume ball
Decked out in the colors of Europe
And on fire with the hope of it all
There my father's own father stood huddled
With the tired and hungry and scared
Turn of the century pilgrims
Bound by the dream that they shared
They were standing in line just like cattle
Poked and sorted and shoved
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom
Some were torn from someone they love
Through this sprawling Tower of Babel
Came a young man, confused and alone
Determined and bound for America
And carrying all that he owned
Sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and I couldn't hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"So don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyes
He would rock and stare out the window
But his eyes are still just as clear
As the day he sailed through the Harbor
And come ashore on that island of tears
My grandfather's days were numbered
But I won't let his memory die
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country
And the look in his immigrant eyes
Sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and couldn't hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"So don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyes
"Don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyesWhen the evening sun goes down
You will find me hanging round
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used-to-be's
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
Listen to the blues they're playing
Listen to what the blues are saying
My life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
And the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life
The night life ain't no good life
But it's my lifePlaymate, come out and play with me
And bring your dollies, three
Climb up my apple tree
Look down my rain-barrel
Slide down my cellar door
And we'll be jolly friends forever more
But she couldn't come out and play
It was a rainy day
With tearful eye she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say
I'm sorry, playmate, I cannot play with you
My dolly's got the flu, boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hasn't got no rain-barrel, hasn't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends forever more
But she couldn't come out and play
It was a rainy day
With tearful eye she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say
I'm sorry, playmate, I cannot play with you
My dolly's got the flu, boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Hasn't got no rain-barrel, hasn't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends forever moreThe crops are all in, and the peaches are rotten
The oranges are all packed in the creosote dumps
They're flying them back to the Mexican Border
To save all their money, and wade back again
My father's own father, he waded that river
Others before him have done just the same
They died in the hills, and they've died in the valley
Some went to heaven, without any name
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mi amigo, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "Deportee"
Some of us are illegal, and others not wanted
Our work contracts out, and we have to move on
Six-hundred miles to the Mexican Border
They chase us like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mi amigo, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "Deportee"
The sky-plane caught fire, over Los Gatos Canyon
A fireball a thunder, it shook all the hills
Who are all these dear friends, scattered like dry leaves?
The radio said they were just deportees
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mi amigo, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "Deportee"
Goodbye to my Juan
Adios a mi Juan
Goodbye Rosalita
Adios Rosalita
Adios mi amegos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
No tendrá un nombre en el aeroplano
All they will call you
Le llamarán serán
Will be
Va a hacer
DeporteeFunny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by my bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
Sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at allI been sittin' around countin' my blessings
Thinkin' of friends here and gone
Recallin' the smile across somebody's face
Whenever I'd sing her a song
The Good Book says "Love everybody"
And the Lord knows I really have tried
So I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I have missed
And I'll try to do better next time
By next time I might be a preacher
Or an eagle gliding away
I hope that my spirit will make someone happy
When I'm gone to come back again
The Good Book says "Love everybody"
And the Lord knows I really have tried
So I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I have missed
And I'll try to do better next time
The Good Book says "Love everybody"
And the Lord knows I really have tried
So I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I missed
And I'll try to do better next time
The Good Book says "Love everybody"
And the Lord knows I really have tried
I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I missed
And I'll try to do better next time
I'll try to do better next timeI've got a couple more years on you, baby and that's all
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
It ain't that I'm wiser, it's just that I've spent
More time with my back to the wall
I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby and that's all
I've walked a couple more roads than you, baby and that's all
And I'm tired of running while you're only learning to crawl
And you're headed somewhere but I've been to somewhere
And found it was nowhere at all
I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby and that's all
Saying goodbye girl, don't ever come easy at all
But you're gonna fly 'cause you're hearin' them young eagles call
Someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall
You'll say, I've got a couple more years on you, baby and that's all
I've got a couple more years on you, baby, that's all
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
It ain't that I'm wiser, it's just that I've spent
More time with my back to the wall
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby and that's allWoke up this morning with the sundown shining in
Found my mind in a brown paper bag again
Tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky
And I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and followed it in
Met myself crawling out as I was crawling in
I woke up so tight i said I'd never unwind
I saw so much that it broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
Somebody painted April Fool in big black letters
On a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas
When I left the road, it blew out my mind
Eight miles out of Memphis, Lord, I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Lord, lord, lord, what condition my condition was in
What condition my condition was in
Songwriter:  Mickey NewburyPretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Crowded streets, busy feet hustle by you
Downtown shoppers Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by
Should you stop? Better not much too busy
You better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Oh, oh, pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blueA long time forgotten are dreams that just felt by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She's just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
He likes the night life the brightlights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
To be a good hearted woman to a do no good good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked mouth ways hat she don't understandCan't go home if you're going by the mill
Cause the bridge's washed out
At the bottom of the hill
Big Creek's up Little Creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer
Sitting in the window singing to my love
Slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and the grasshopper eating ice cream
Mule got sick so they laid him on the beam
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer
Well you ought to see my Blue Eyed Sally
She lives away down on Shinbone Alley
Number on the gate the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longerSomewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle againI've got a long list of real good reasons
For all the things I've done
I've got a picture in the back of my mind
Of what I've lost and what I've won
I've survived every situation
Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow
And there's nothing I can do about it now
I've got a wild and a restless spirit
I held my price through every deal
I've seen the fire of a woman's scorn
Turn her heart of gold to steel
I've got the song of the voice inside me
Set to the rhythm of the wheel
And I've been dreaming like a child
Since the cradle broke the bough
And there's nothing I can do about it now
Running through the changes
Going through the stages
Coming round the corners in my life
Leaving doubt to fate
Staying out too late
Waiting for the moon to say goodnight
And I could cry for the time I've wasted
But that's a waste of time and tears
And I know just what I'd change
If went back in time somehow
But there's nothing I can do about it now
Running through the changes
Going through the stages
Coming round the corners in my life
Leaving doubt to fate
Staying out too late
Waiting for the moon to say goodnight
And I could cry for the time I've wasted
But that's a waste of time and tears
And I know just what I'd change
If went back in time somehow
But there's nothing I can do about it now
I'm forgiving everything that forgiveness will allow
And there's nothing I can do about it nowBring me sunshine in your smile, bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow
Make me happy through the years, never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun, bring me sunshine, bring me love
Bring me sunshine in your smile, bring me laughter all the while
In this world where we live there should be more happiness
So much joy you can give to each brand new bright tomorrow
Make me happy through the years, never bring me any tears
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun, bring me sunshine, bring me love
Bring me sunshine in your smile, bring me laughter all the while
Let your arms be as warm as the sun from up above
Bring me fun, bring me sunshine, bring me loveWe skipped the light fandango
And turned cartwheels cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
And the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waitress brought a tray
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
She said There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Were leaving for the coast
Although both my eyes were wide-open
They might just just have well been closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
]
She said she wanted shore leave
Tho in truth we were at sea
So I took her by a looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying you must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride
Well she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died
And so it wasMy favorite picture of you
Is the one where you're staring
Straight into the lens
It's just a Polaroid shot
Someone took on the spot
No beginning, no end
Just a moment in time that you can't have back
You never left but your bags were packed
Just in case
My favorite picture of you
Is bent and it's faded
And it's pinned to my wall
Oh, and you were so angry
That it's hard to believe
That we were lovers at all
There's a fire in your eyes, your heart's on your sleeve
A curse on your lips, but all I can see is beautiful
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where
Your wings are showing
And your arms are crossed
And your fists are clenched
Not gone, but going
A stand-up angel who won't back down
Nobody's fool and nobody's clown
You were smarter than that
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where
It hasn't rained yet
And as I recall
There came a winter squall
And we got soaking wet
A thousand words in the blink of an eye
The camera loves you and so do I
Click
My favorite picture of you
Is the one where you're staring
Straight into the lensThe whole sky opens up
And it rains down on my head
I show up at your door
Beat down and soaking wet
I know you'll open up
And let me waltz right in
My come whatever
Unfair weather friend
If I find myself out lost
On a lonely Friday night
The songs aren't hitting home
And the whiskey don't taste right
The few numbers on the phone
And you're on the other end
My come whatever
Unfair weather friend
And I might wind up
Stuck out
On some old
Forgotten highway
But somehow you show up
And sure enough
Be going my way
You're always there
Right where you've always been
My come whatever
Unfair weather friend
I don't have to wonder
Where'll you be if I should need you
All I have to do
Is close my eyes and I can see you
Always there
Right where you've always been
Sometimes this whole world
Is my worst enemy
And I know where to run
When it gets to me
No one else but you
Can make it all make sense
My come whatever
Unfair weather friend
My come whatever
Unfair weather friend
Written by Marla Cannon-Goodman and Ward DavisAll of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see that I'm no good without you
Take my arms I want to lose them
Take my lips I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
And I know that I am no good without you
You took apart that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see that I'm no good without you
Take my arms I want to lose them
Take my lips I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
And I know that I am no good without you
You took apart that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
Neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm going to say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
Oh, the answer is no
Baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is so vicious
Your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home
Maybe you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and diedI'd have to be crazy
To stop all my singing
And never play music again
You'd call me a fool
If I grabbed up the top hat
And ran out to flag down the wind
I'd have to be weird
To grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do
But I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you
I know I've done weird things
I told people I heard things
When silence was all abounds
Been days when it pleased me
To be on my knees
Following ants
As they crawl across the ground
Been insane on a train
But I'm still me again
In a place where I hold you is true
So I know I'm alright
Cause I'd have to be crazy
To fall out of love with you
You know I
And I don't intend to
But should there come a day
When I say that I don't love you
You can lock me away ay ay
I sure would be dingy
To live in an envelope
Waiting along for a stamp
You'd swear I was loco
To rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp
And I may not be normal
But nobody is
So I'd like to say before I'm through
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you
I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with youDelete and fast forward my friend
The wars are all over and nobody wins
But don't worry too much, it'll just drive you crazy again
So delete and fast forward my friend
Delete and fast forward my son
The elections are over and nobody won
You think it's all ending, but it's just settin' in
So delete and fast forward my friend
Delete and fast forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning again
What's next was now and what's now is now then
So delete and fast forward again
Delete and fast forward the news
The truth is the truth, but believe what you choose
When we blow the whole world back to where it began
Just delete and fast forward again
Delete and fast forward again
It's just one big circle and it's beginning again
What's next was now and what's now is now then
So delete and fast forward again
We had a chance to be brilliant and we blew it again
So delete and fast forward my friend
Delete and fast forward againI see trees of green red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying 'I love you'
I hear babies crying, watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
And I think to myself, what a wonderful worldWell, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight
As we taxi down the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city
Are extremely real
All the night life and parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight
Well, our golden jet is airborne
And Flight 50 cuts a path
Across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us Flight 50 is the way to fly
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea or something stronger
To start off the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight
Yeah, I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flightWell a man come on the 6 oclock news
Said somebodys been shot, somebodys been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn't get too far yeah
They didn't get too far
Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
Well all meet back at the local saloon
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
Weve got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
Its time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send em all to their maker and hell settle em down
You can bet hell set em down cause
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
Well all meet back at the local saloon
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
Well all meet back at the local saloon
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horsesThere's a little house that sits upon a hill
That little house it sits so quiet and still
And it's filled with memories
And they're calling out to me
Come back to that little house on the hill
That little house it sits so all alone
It needs someone to call it home sweet home
I'm traveling on my way
And I'm going back today
Going back to that little house on the hill
On the hill, on the hill
I'm going back to that little house on the hill
I'm traveling on my way
And I'm leaving here today
Going back to that little house on the hill
That little house has weathered many storms
It's a place that feels so cozy and so warm
It's waiting there for me
And it's where I long to be
I'm going back to that little house on the hill
Now when I get back to that house on the hill
I know it's gonna be such a thrill
I'll be glad when I get there
Back to my favorite chair
I'm going back to that little house on the hill
On the hill, on the hill
I'm going back to that little house on the hill
I'm traveling on my way
I'll be leaving here today
I'm going back to that little house on the hill
I'm going back to that little house on the hillIt was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Just when you think it's all over
It's only begunJust a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As You walk, you will walk close to me
When my feeble life is o'er
And time for me shall be no more
Gently lead me to that shore
Let me walk, let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it beWell he rode into Blue Rock, dusty and tired
And he got him a room for the night
He lay there in silence with too much on his mind
Still hoping that he was not right
But he found them that evening at a tavern in town
In a quiet little out-of-the-way place
And they smiled at each other when he walked through the door
And they died with their smiles on their faces
They died with a smile on their face
Don't boss him, don't cross him, he's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him, just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on againWell she made my day
But it ruined my life
She smiled at me
And I did not think twice
Well I dove right in
Into a world of strife
Well she made my day
But it ruined my life
I was mindin' my own business, a-buzzin' 'round
My mind spinni' faster than the speed of sound
And I was perfectly happy when I ran into her
But she complicated me and the way things were
Well she made my day
But it ruined my life
She smiled at me
And I did not think twice
Well I dove right in
Into a world of strife
Well she made my day
But it ruined my life
We were gettin' along just fine, just me and me
We understood each other perfectly
Then I let my guard down and there she was
Well that's stupid is as stupid does
Well she made my day
But it ruined my life
She smiled at me
And I did not think twice
Well I dove right in
Into a world of strife
Well she made my day
But it ruined my life
She smiled at me
And I did not think twice
Well she made my day
But it ruined my lifeCounted the stars on the 4th of July
Wishing they were rockets bursting into the sky
Talking about redemption and leaving things behind
As the sun sank west of the Mendocino county line
As fierce as Monday morning feeling washed away
Our orchestrated paradise couldn't make you stay
You dance with the horses through the sands of time
As the sun sinks west of the Mendocino county line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doing fine
I used to make you happy once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino county line
The two of us together felt nothing but right
Feeling you near immortal every Friday night
Lost in our convictions left stained with wine
As the sun sank west of the Mendocino county line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doing fine
I used to make you happy once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino county line
I don't talk to you too much these days
I just thank the Lord pictures don't fade
I spent time with an angel just passing through
Now all that's left is this image of you
Counted the stars on the 4th of July
Wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
Talking about redemption and leaving things behind
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know i'm doing fine
We used to be so happy once upon a time
Once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino county line
And the sun sank west of the Mendocino county lineI could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that factAfter carefully considering
The whole situation I stand with my back to the wall
Walking is better than running away and crawling ain't no good at all
And if guilty's the question truth is the answer I've been lying to me all alone
There ain't nothing worth saving except one another
And before you'll wake up I'll be gone
 
And crawling ain't no good at allWell I've been a lot of places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages with ten thousand people watching
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for you
And I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
No one more important to me darling can't you please see through me
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for you
Well you taught me precious secrets of a truth with holding nothing
You came out in front but I was hiding
Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
And I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for youYou are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
The other night dear as I laid sleeping I dreamed I held you by my side
When I awoke dear I was mistaken and I hung my head and cry
You are my sunshine
You told me once dear you really loved me and no one else could come between
But now you've left me and you love another and you have shattered all my dreams
I'll always love you and make you happy if you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another you'll regret it all some dayWhen I ran to the store with a penny
And when youth was abundant and plenty
Classify these as good times
Good times
When I rolled rubber tires in the driveway
Pulled a purse on a string across the highway
Classify these as good times
Good times
Good times are coming, humming mmm
Good times are coming, humming mmm
Go to school, fight a war, working steady
Meet a girl, fall in love before I'm ready
Classify these as good times
Good times
Here I sit with a drink and a memory
But I'm not cold, I'm not wet, and I'm not hungry
So classify these as good times
Good times
Good times are coming, humming mmm
Good times
Good times are coming, humming mmmI made a mistake Lord
I thought I was wrong
I said take it and git
She said got it and gone
So I'm writing it all down
In this stupid ol' song
I made a mistake Lord
I thought I was wrong
I'm a lot like ol' Ripley
On "Believe It Or Not"
I told a big lie Lord
And then I forgot
I thought I was Jesus
And believe me I'm not
I thought I was right
And I was wrong by a lot
I feel a little like Elvis
When he was alone
I made another mistake Lord
I thought I was wrong
I made a mistake Lord
And it's all on me
I wouldn't admit it
But it's easy to see
So if anyone's praying
A request I would make
Is to mention my name 'cause
I made a mistake
I'm a lot like ol' Ripley
On "Believe It Or Not"
I told a big lie Lord
And then I forgot
I thought I was Jesus
And believe me I'm not
I thought I was right
And I was wrong by a lot
I feel a little like Elvis
When he was alone
I made another mistake Lord
I thought I was wrong
I made another mistake Lord
I thought I was wrongWell, last night I came home and I knocked on my door
And I called to my love as I oft' had before
And I knocked and I knocked; no answer there came
No kisses to greet me, no voice called my name
And I couldn't believe it was true, oh Lord
Couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true
Well, the shock was so great I am quivering yet
And I'll try to forgive but I cannot forget
My heart breaking loss is another man's gain
Her happiness, always, I hope will remain
And I couldn't believe it was true, oh Lord
Couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true
