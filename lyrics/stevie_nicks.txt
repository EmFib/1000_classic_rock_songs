Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo-whoo-whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby 
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment
That I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow, yeah, yeah
Well, the music there
Well it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With their words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
Nothin' else mattered
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colours
But the sea
Does not change
So with the slow graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
Well then suddenly
There was no one left standing
In the hall, yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
When I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin'
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
Well, I hear you 
In the morning 
And I hear you 
At nightfall 
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you
My love
I'm a few years older than you, my love
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whooBaby, you'll come knocking on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
I said yeah, well what am supposed to do?
I didn't know what I was getting into
So you've had a little trouble in town
Now you're keeping some demons down
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
It's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you've lost
This doesn't have to be the big get even
This doesn't have to be anything at all
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
People running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
You need someone looking after you
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart aroundIs love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile, try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my laceNo one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran
No one knows how I feel
What I say, unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line 
To be standing in a line
I would cry
La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la
Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow, I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came
So, I walked on down, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love, and that was all
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line 
To be standing in a line
I would cry
La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
Doo-doo, doo-doo
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la, wo-ah
So, I walked, walked down the line, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not call
Well, he asked me for my love, that was all
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line 
To be standing in a line
I would cry
Need a little, need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy 
Well, I need a little sympathy
Well, you could be standing in 
Well, you could be standing in 
Well, you could be standing in 
Take me home
Take me home 
Won't you take me home?
Well, I need a little sympathy 
Well, you could be standing in 
Why don't you take me home?
Why don't you take me home? 
Take me home 
Take me home Something in my heart died last night
Just one more chip off an already broken heart
I think the heart broke long ago
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most
That's when I needed you
When I needed you most
I run around like a spirit in flight
Fearlessness is fearlessness
I will not forget this night
Dare my wild heart
Dare my wild heart
Where is the reason?
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
As do the seasons
You fought from the beginning
Long before I knew it
There was a danger
And the danger was to fall in love
In dark sorrow, they gaze down into the darkest heart
If I leave you
You say not even you can tear us apart, whoa
Say you're leaving
You say you don't even know how to start
How to start, how to start
Well, believe it then, and don't blame it on my soul
Blame it on my wild heart, ooh
On my wild heart, ooh
Fire on fire, rain on my face
Fever goes higher, what can you do?
Wild in the darkest places in your mind
That's where I needed you 
Where I needed you most
That's where I needed you 
Where I needed you most
Where is the reason?
Well don't blame it on me
Blame it on my wild heart
There is a reason why even the angels don't give it up at all
Where are the children?
Well, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Blame it on the angels
Where are the reasons?
Don't blame it on us 
Blame it on our wild heart
Wild heart, wild heart, wild heart
On my wild heart
On my wild heart
Even in the darkest places of your mind
Even in the darkest places of your mind
Whoa, are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Are the children, are they hopelessly enchanted?
Wild in the darkest places of your mind
Darkest places of your mind
No, don't blame it on me, baby
Blame it on my wild heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Blame it on my wild heart
Blame it on my wild heart 
Blame it on my wild heart 
Blame it on my wild, wild, wild
Wild heart
Blame it on my wild heart
Even in the darkest places of your mindYou can ride high atop your pony
I know you won't fall
'Cause the whole thing's phoney
You can fly, swingin' from your trapeze
Scaring all the people
But you never scare me
Bella donna
And we fight for the northern star
No speed limit
This is the fast lane
It's just the way that it is here
And you say
"I never thought it could"
Bella donna
We fight for the northern star
And the lady's feeling
Like the moon that she loved
Don't you know that the stars are
A part of us
And the lady's feeling
Just like the moon that she loved
And you say
"I never thought it could"
Bella donna
Come in out of the darkness
You are in love with
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
Sort of captures your soul
Bella donna
And the woman may be awestruck
And the woman may truly care
But the woman is so tired
So the woman disappears
Come in out of the darkness
Bella donna, my soul
Don't change, baby, please don't change
And you say
And your face becomes thin
You never thought it could
Come in out of the darkness
Bella donna
You are a love wind
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feelingSomewhere out in the back of your mind 
Comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light
She had trusted many...
But been unfamiliar with...
Almost everyone but you
Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you
She had trusted many...
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles...
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried... and she tried to taunt him
And he hated to be separated...
From that picture... No...
Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you
Long nets of white cloud my memory...
Long nets of white cloud my memory...
Ooh... there is magic... all around you...
Every time you walk in the room...
Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you
Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known youAnd the summer became the fall
I was not ready for the winter
It makes no difference at all
'Cause I wear boots all summer long
My eye makeup, dark, and it's careless
Same circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin
My eyes, without any shadow
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight
The winter's really here now
And the blankets that I love
Sometimes I am surrounded by too much love
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
And the darkened eyes, through the net of the lace
In the darkness, it's hard to see her face
Pulls back the net
And you feel the touch  of her fingers
And you see she turns the eyes
And you see the eyes of a nightbird
The ones you dream of
Finally the night bird
Finally the night bird
TonightI can see
We're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see
Your expression when the phone rings
We both know
There's something happening here
There's no sense
In dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse
When it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now
There's nothing here to fear
You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby
Dusty words
Lying under carpets
Seldom heard
Well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view
Do I seem all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, I've searched
Through all my cards
Well, isn't that enough
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me
Though we lay face to face
And cheek to cheek
Our voices stray
From common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear
Let the walls burn down
Set your secret free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here
You can talk to me
Talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings
And I can see
That we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?
Well I can see you, baby
Well I can see you, baby
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone ringsOne so young so changed
Should not be left alone
Two in love should confess
And not be left alone
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to you
You've had time come around
Will you please make up your mind
I stand accused on trial
Will you please make up your mind
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to you
Make it easy for me
I been lonely baby
Show some mercy honey
I was nothing
All those lonely nights
Showed me something
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
I will run to you
Down whatever road you choose
I will follow you down
I will run to youHas anyone ever written anything for you
In all your darkest hours
Have you ever heard me sing
Listen to me now
You know I'd rather be alone
Than be without you
Don't you know
Has anyone ever given anything to you
In your darkest hours
Did you ever give it back
Well I have
I have given that to you
If it's all I ever do
This is your song
And the rain comes down
There's no pain and there's no doubt
It was easy to say
I believed in you everyday
If not for me then
Do it for the world
Has anyone ever written anything for you
In your darkest sorrow
Did you ever hear me sing
Listen to me now
You know I'd rather be alone
Than be without you
Don't you know
So, if not for me, then
Do it for yourself
If not for me then
Do it for the world
Poet
Priest of nothing
Legend

Priest of nothing
LegendOutside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
Are you lonely?
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Could you love me only?
Look at me, for a very long time
Long enough to know
Love is a word I've been trying to find
Words don't matter
They don't matter at all
So you're still lonely
You say that it's been forever
Maybe you never knew me
Maybe you thought that
I'd never change
But you know I'm changing
You're wrong
And it's been like dying
No love's that hard to find
And I'm tired of
And I'm tired of trying
And I'm tired of trying
Maybe it's only a dream
I don't want to feel that
Well it's one more link in the chain, I know
I don't believe that
Outside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Would you love me only?
Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one
That can take my place
Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one that
Can ever replace that heartache
Take away that heartache
Love is a word that some entertain
If you find it
You have won the game
Somebody said
"Outside the rain"Temptation falls in your path
"No hesitation, why?" you ask
You have another waiting at home
And, yes, she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
You didn't mean to meet her you cry
Oh, but the sun goes down every night
She came to you when you were alone
And, yes, she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Oh, kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
I promised myself a long time ago
No, it would be difficult to let you go
If not at least within
The touch of my fingers
It was close to being
In heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To being in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To be
Heaven
I know, I knowStep into the velvet of the morning
Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know it's not as bad as it seems
Well I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Oh and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well think about it
Think about it before you go
And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
It is that you want from me
I am just one small part
Of forever
Falling, star, star
Catcher
Even when you feel like your life is fading
I know that you'll go on forever
You're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Your fortune is your life's love
Well honey
I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Whoa and
Anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well think about it
Think about it before you go

It is that you want from me
I am just one small part

Think about it before you go
And the heart says danger
The heart says whatever
Think about it
Think about it before you goI saw him the other day
I saw him again...yesterday
I wonder if I'll ever see him again
He reminded me of Blue Denim
Blue-gray eyes...they change with the color...
Change with the sun...they run with the sight
They change with the wind...but they're always bright
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
I knew him another way
I knew him another day
In some ways he'd forgotten me
In many ways he got to me
I turned away so he couldn't see
I turned away...it could never be
I never thought he could walk away
But I lost him again...yesterday
Blue-gray eyes...they change with the color...
Change with the sun...they run with the sight
They change with the wind...but they're always bright
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
Understanding me...understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do
Understanding me...and understanding you
Is not an easy thing to do
And I will never forget...
The last time I saw you
Like a photograph...so rare
Like a painting
No I will never forget...
The last time I saw you
Never to be...not you...not me
No...no...
Blue-gray eyes...they change with the color...
Change with the sun...they run with the sight
They change with the wind...but they're always bright
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
So I'm going away for a little while
To remember how to feel
And if I find the answer...
I promise you...I'll come back and get you
So I'm going away for a little while

I'll come back and get youI got to sing, I got to dance
I got to be a part of a great romance
Still forbidden
Still outrageous
Only a few around us knew
But no one said a word
It was contagious
Looked out the windows
We watched the cars fly by
I look at you and I start to cry
What you did was…
You saved my life
I won’t forget it
You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth
I got to love, I rode the rails
You came with me because you cared
I was broken, I was scared
You held my hands and took away my fear
We knew it couldn’t last
And that was hard
We looked out the windows
We watched the cars fly by
I look at you and I start to cry
What you did was…
You saved my life
I won’t forget it
You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth
I got to sing, I got to dance
I got to be a part of a great romance

Well you saved my life
I won’t forget it
You said, even if I
Left my girlfriend
Packed up my stuff
Loaded up my car
Drove down to your house
With good intentions
Came thru your door
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worthStill the same old story
What price glory
You make it easy
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
How still my
Doing all you can for me
They say you're not the man for me
Don't make it easy
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
How still my love
Standing in the doorway
Watching out to sea
Calling out to me
You go your way
Go on, go on
But you don't forget me
Oh no, you don't forget me
Oh no, my lonely one
You're doing all you can for me
They say you're not the man for me
Don't I make it easy
In the still of the night
It's me, talking to you
How still my love
In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
It's me that's talkin' to you
In the still of the night
It's me that's talkin' to you
In the still of the night
AlwaysAlas he was the highwayman
The one that comes and goes
And only the highway-woman
Keeps up with the likes of those
And she in all her magic
With hands as quick as light
Took him to be a challenge
And went into the night
And he in all his glory
Was far ahead of her
But she was never sorry
For wishes that would burn
Enter competition
She chases beneath the moon
Her horse is like a dragonfly
She is just a fool
And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of a dream
And then he sees her coming
Heartbeats on the wind
Considers slowing down
But then he could never win
And she out in the distance
Sees him against the sky
A pale and violent rider
A dream begun in wine
And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of a dream
A dream as the thunder wakes her
And her highwayman disappears
On a life already lived before
In eyes welled with tears
Today and still today they ride
Will they ever win
He the glory
She the love
And still they try again
He the glory
She the love
And still they try again
He the glory
She the love
And still they try againThe bright light is lying down
Earth and the sea and the sky
Is at rest with the ocean
And the days go by
They go into the seas that have no shores
Haunted by that same closed door
Looking up at skies on fire
Leaving nothing left of us
To discover
And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear, out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be, no light
No doubt, no pain
Come ever again, well
Let there be light in this lifetime
In the cool, silent moments of the nighttime
And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
We will never change again, the way that we are changing
Well, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream, no
I still wish you gone
And I will live alone
Yes, I will live alone
And the planets of the universe, go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear, out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be, no light
You will never love again the way you love me
You will never rule again the way you ruled me
You will never change again the way you're changing
You will never rule again the way you ruled me...In the city of dreams
Lies the city's ghost
There's a beginning
There's a middle and an end in this city
We reach out for the middle ground
We throw a great party
So hearts will start to mend
We forgive… at least we try
In the midst of the sea of dreams
Lies a perfect storm
In the sea of tears
Lies a city ghost
In the spirit of the Mardi Gras
Well, the people hope
That their lives will get better
The people hope
That their lives will get better
I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
And go down Bourbon Street
I see a sea of smiles
I see a haunted city reachin' out
I see hope in all their faces
Behind the mask of Mardi Gras
Where the good and the righteous walk
And the wicked as well
I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by the vampires
I wanna dress up, ooh yea
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
And go down Bourbon Street
Mmmm, go on down Bourbon Street
Within these rooms
I go up to my balcony
And I hang the paintings on the wall
And I open up my gallery
And I open up my doors
I stare at the city
I stare at my city
I wanna get a room in New Orleans
I wanna sing in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by the vampires
I wanna get back to New Orleans
I wanna sing out in the streets of the French Quarter
I wanna dress up
I wanna wear beads
I wanna wear feathers and lace
I wanna brush by Anne Rice
Go down Bourbon Street
Go down Bourbon Street
Go on down Bourbon Street
Go on down Bourbon Street
Go on down
Go on down
Go on down
Go on down Bourbon Street
In the city of tears
Lies the city ghostI took my love, I took it down
Climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Till the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
Mmmm mmm mmm mmm
Well, I've been 'fraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well, I've been 'fraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm gettin' older too
Oh I'm gettin' older too
Ahh, take my love, take it down
Ahh, climb a mountain and turned around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide'll bring it down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide'll bring it down
Oh the landslide'll bring it downI can't wait
How will I love you
I can't wait, I can't wait
Sometime she talks to him
Sometimes while she's only dreaming
Then when she wakes up
Somehow she still believes him
Yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
Yes, I know you
To be continued, it's too much, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
Well, if I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
Yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
What can I do when I'm crazy for you
She wonders how many more hours
Her heart will feel broken
In secret she says she needs to see him
But no words are spoken
Well, she dances around in a circle
Well, she's got that feeling now
Blame it on something at first sight
Put the blame on me if you want to
To be continued
I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, now baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
What can I do when I'm crazy for you, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time, make up your mind, baby
How will I love you
How will I love you
I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
Wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
How will I love you
How will I love youI remember him, he was very young
No one spoke like him, he was someone
And I carried on like I couldn't stop
All of it for us, baby
And you, you got in my way
Stood between me and my friends
It was my sin, it was my shame
You were unconscious to the pain I was in
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back to the sea
With honor be it spoken
To understand this light that we carry
And let it light your way
Of course you know I generally take it
Well, I make accommodations for you
And consider this
You used to be my love
I make excuses for you
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back to the sea
You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
I know you can, I've seen you do it
And it brings up the wind
And it rises around you in pillars of color
But the promise has been broken
As you walk through the shadow of death
You try to see no evil
But you are so heartbroken
You say "Dear God, make it stop!"
Before the dawn of separation
Brings up the wind
Rises around you
I hear there'e trouble in Shangri-La
Pillars of color
Trouble in Shangri-La
I make accommodations for you
I guess we don't believe
That things could go this far
We all believe in people
That we think believe in God
Somewhere in the night
Someone feels the pain
The ones who walk away
Try to love again
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Down to the sea
Show me the way back, honey
I hear there's trouble in Shangri-La
I run through the grass
I run over the stones
Show me the way back to the sea
You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
Because you are so heartbroken
You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
Before the dawn of separation
You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
Show me the way backI hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, "If anyone falls in love, it will be one of us."
If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls
And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away, he said, "I have loved many women
I have many times run away."
Ooh, I have never known the words
Well, I have tried to be true
But I have never known what to say, how to say
Seen anything today
I've never seen anything like you
If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls
So, I'm never gonna see you 
Deep inside my heart
But I see your shadow against, shadow against
Shadow against the wall
Baby, I see your shadow against the wall
I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
Ooh, I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, "If anyone falls in love, it will be done to us."
If anyone falls in love 
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind 
If anyone falls
If anyone falls in love 
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind 
If anyone fallsLearn to be a stranger
Blond on blond
In silence, she says, "Excalibur."
I beg of you now
What was it that fell?
Was it one fallen leaf, like the feather that it was?
Was it freedom by choice, or baby was it love?
Was it a thorn in your side?
Something that you hide
Something you don't touch because it hurts too much, ooh
Well, have you come to see that my face is not seen?
Ooh, outside my frost-covered windows
Oh, and just how deep do you hold that dream?
In your hands each night
This time
In your hands each night
This time
Oh, was it you I heard calling?
Which voice?
Well, I know that you are goin'
Which voice
Did I force you to remember in the sacred name of love?
Well to be brave, save the stranger
Sable on blond
Dark upon light
Because it hurts too much
Just how deep do you hold that dream?
In your hands each night
In your hands each night
Oh, in your hands each night
Ooh, what was it that fell?
Ooh, I beg of you now
What was it that fell
Well this time I think it was you, babe
Well, this time I think that it was you, babe, whoa, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, baby, this time
Ooh, well, I think it was you, babyWell I never thought I'd make it
Here in Hollywood
I never thought I'd ever want to stay
What I seem to touch these days
Has turned to gold
What I seem to want
Well you know I'll find a way
For me, it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
The loneliness of a one night stand
Is hard to take
We all chase something
And maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a rock and roll woman
While her heart breaks
Oh you know, the dream keeps coming
Even when you forget to feel
For me, it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
Oh you know the feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
Oh the feeling remain
Even after the glitter fadesSilent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round your Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is bornBefore you I thought I'd lost
They called the game but not for us
Drowned in thought and caught in a stare
Talking to ghosts who were not there
Then you took my hand
Transformation began
Commotion where it once was still
Fireworks explode
Front row tickets to the show
This hand I will never let it go
A crooked trail I've come across
Who can know what's meant for us
So if I get caught, what's fair is fair
Every single cloud will fall from the air
Then you took my hand
Transformation began
Commotion where it once was still
Fireworks explode
Front row tickets to the show
This hand I will never let it go
Your hand I will never let it go
Your hand I will never let it go
Your hand I will never let it go
Your hand I will never let it go
Your hand I will never let it goWe don't talk much about it
It goes back so many years
All the times we almost didn't make it
We stayed clear
Dancing with the devil
Call it respect, call it fear
But we never allowed the devil come to the party
We were careful in our own way
We walk through the darkness
We made a pact not to dance with the devil
Even when the devil seemed to have a heart
He said we’d never be sorry
For what we’d done
And we never allowed the devil
To come to the party
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
Hearts breaking, right and left
Friendships break like glass
And the devil pours another glass
It’s so easy
The devil pours a glass of champagne
Asks someone new to dance
It's so easy to ruin people's lives
He twirls around and starts to laugh
Tear up the invitation
Hear the bells ring on the hour
Twirls around and he laughs
You can't fix this, you lost your friend
Hearts breaking, right and left
Friendships break like glass
And the devil pours another glass
No, we never allowed the devil
To come to the party
Yes, we said that we would never be sorry
For what we’d done
Never go to the party
If you think you won’t come home
Never dance with the devil
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
He will burn you down
Hearts breaking, right and left
Well, never dance with the devil
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
He will burn you down
Hearts breaking, right and left
Never dance with the devil
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
He will burn you down
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
Don’t ever dance with the devil
You can’t fix this, you lost a friend
He will burn you down
You can’t fix this
You can’t fix this
You can’t fix this
You can’t fix this
You can’t fix thisIn the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
Well you used to love... to be behind... those walls with her
Within these walls...
Well he watched from the corridor...
Watched from the corner of his eyes...
Seemingly waiting for the time...
When the castle walls... would all fall down
Yes it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Oh... but there was a time when... he called her "angel"
Where in the world did you come from?
In the shadow of the castle walls
Wherever those walls were
In this land or in that land
Well the castles all seem to belong to her
And all this talk... about love and hate
And our separation way on down the line...
Well they just can't wait, can they?
No they just can't wait...
There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber...
Where they spent all their time, well...
There was a light that lighted the way to the chamber door where...
They seemed to spend all their time...
Ooh my love... Ooh my love... Ooh my love...
Yeah it was a strain on her...
Watching her castles fall down
Hey, hey, baby... No one can take you away from me... no... no one...
In the shadow of the castle walls...You think you hear demons
I think we are the demons
In this place where the images are born
You remember your childhood
Oh, in fiery sequences
The sun goes down, filling the air with colors
Winds lift you up to god, lift you up to god
You fall to your knees, you embrace the storm
You know longer care if it's cold or if it's warm
You live for the danger, oh like your passion and your anger
You don't let go
You like to be twisted, by the force
You like to be shaken by the wind
In this game that you play with god
You've been warned to retreat
You take it to the limit
When the winds come up
Crazy men, crazy women
Cryin' out for love
You like to save her
Ooh, but you just can't give it up
You'd rather be wrapped up in the arms of a storm
You'd rather be wrapped up in the arms of a storm
Crazy men, crazy women
In the storm
And the sun goes down
Chasin' down the demons
You think you hear demons
Well, I got your demons
They're cryin' out for love
Cryin' out for love
Cryin' out for love
Cryin' out for love
Crazy men, crazy women
In the storm
And the sun goes down
They're still chasin' down the demons
And you think you hear demons
Well, I got your demons
They're cryin' out for love
And they lift you up to god
Lift you up to god
And you don't let go
'Cause you like to be twisted...There's a plane, it's headed for London
Twenty-four hours more and he'll be on it
And I can't show my love, and I can't stop it
Oh, I can't stop it
There's a house there, somebody's waiting
Somebody else's arms will wrap around him
And in that moment, what will he think then
When I can't touch him
Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home
In a room just outside of Houston
That's where I spend my nights, trying to get through to him
He says he's comin' back in every letter
But he might never
No he might never
Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home
Does he know how long
I've waited for this love to come
Does he know I'm holdin' on
And that won't change no matter where he's gone
Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home
Couldn't I, couldn't I wait
Couldn't he stay one more day
Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home

Crying in the morning, trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
And destiny says that I'm destined to fall
Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Why the sad face, oh, darling?
Was it my darkness shadow light?
I mean to cause no trouble for you
That is the story of my life
Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted
Woah, it's just a voice through the night
Enchanted
Well, I hope you make it
You were gone, you were gone from me
When I remember someone, I remember their dreams
In those dreams that no one knows of
My destiny says that I'm destined to run
Enchanted
You thought you saw something in my eyes
Enchanted
It's a shame that you wanted me
You didn't try
Enchanted
Woah, it's just a voice through the night
Enchanted
Well, I hope you make it
Oh, enchanted
Well, I hope you make it
Woah, woah, woah
I hope you make it
Woah, woah, woah
I hope you make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you make itTake me if you need me
But never hold me down
You're asking me to trust you
Well there's little of that around
I'm trying to believe you
And I'm learning all the time
Two-part personality
The flower and the vine
Take me sleeping angel
Catch me when you can
Real love affairs are heavy spells
For a women and a man
I need you because you let me breathe
Well you've taken me away
But never take me lighty
Or I can never stay
Well, someday when we're older
And my hair is silver grey
Unbraid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft silver chain
Oh, take me sleeping angel
Oh, catch me when you can
And unbraid with all of the love that you have
Like a soft siver chainCome on it's time to go upstairs
But I don't want to be leaving you here
I can't go be in that room alone
When I know that you're down here in tears
I'm not asking "forever" from you
I'm just asking to be held for awhile
In a timeless search for love that might work
We're already paying the price
But you need some rest
My darling, it's best
But we've already passed it, I cried
Ooohee...
Listen to me
My secret love secretly
Died
Come on it's time to go outside
'Cause I don't want to be leaving you here
I can't go be in that world alone
When I know that you're down here in tears
I am not asking "salvation" from you
I'm just asking to be safe for awhile
In a timeless search for love that might work
Still we're already paying the price
But you need some rest
Darling, it's best
But we've already passed it, I cried
Ooohee..
Listen to me
My secret love secretly
Died
Oh, you need some rest
Oh, you need some rest
My darling, it's best
Ooh...
My secret love secretly
Secretly diedBlue water
Sit and I wait
For the morning to come
Blue water
And I wait for the sound of my gypsy
Blue water
I sit not in flight
Hidden, not in sight
Blue water
Blue water
And I stare at the sea
And the sea smiles for me
And the sea
Is as moving
As a lover
I can't give up the night
I'm in high tide
I'd like to sail the sea
I'd like to take you on a slow ride

I sit and I wait for the morning to come

I sit not in flight
Hidden, not in sight

Blue water
Well I sit and I wait
For the morning to come
Blue water
Then I wait for the sound of my gypsy
Blue water
Well I sit and I wait
For the morning to comeIt was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
This maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love... and be loved... by me
She was a child and I was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
We loved with a love that was more than a love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged angels of heaven
They coveted her, and me
And the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
The angels not half so happy in heaven
When envying her and me
That was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
The wind came out of the cloud that night
Killing my, my Annabel Lee
And the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
But our love was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the moon never beams
Without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines
But I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
I lie down... by the side of my darling
My life, my life and my bride
I lie down... by her side
I lie down by her side, my darling
My life, my life and my bride
I lie down... by her side
I lie down
By her side
I lie down
By the side
Oh I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
And my bride
I lie down
Ooooohhh
I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
I lie down
By the side
Of my darling
My life, my life
And my bride
I lie down
Oooh
I lie down
I lie down
Oooh
By the sideYou're not a stranger to me
And you're something to see
You don't even know how to please
You say a lot but you're unaware how to leave
My darling lives in a world that is not mine
An old child misunderstood out of time
Timeless is the creature who is wise
And timeless in the prisoner in disguise
Oh who is the beauty who the beast
Would you die of grieving when I leave
Two children too blind to see
I would fall in your shadow I believe
My love is a man who's not been tamed
Oh my love lives in a world of false pleasure and pain
We come from different worlds we are the same my love
I never doubted your beauty I changed
I never doubted your beauty I changed
Changed who is the beauty
Where is my beast 
There is no beauty
Without my beast 
Who is the beauty
Who my love
Ahhh
Oh la bete la bete
Where is my beast
My beauty my beauty
My beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beastDo you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around, and the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love, that had finally, finally found me
And I knew
In the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountain
Through the crystal-like clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet...
To the sea
How the faces of love changed turning the pages
And I have changed
Oh but you, you remain ageless...
I turned around, and the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love
That had finally, finally found me
And I knew
In the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountain
Through the crystal-like clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet...
To the seaIf it's me that's driving you to this madness
Then there's one thing that I'd like to say
Did you take a look at your life and your lovers?
Nothing ever changes
Ooh, it was just the first time that I ever played for you
Oh, I could be the dancer of your dreams
I can turn all your music on
I can make you feel alive
I am gone, but I'm never gone from you
It was just the first time
Come back, little boy
Baby, come back, yeah
Little boy
Ooh, it's just me that lies waiting
Well, it could come from anywhere
Oh, it could come out straight, straight from my heart
Nothing can be saved here
I can turn all your music on
I can make you feel alive
I am gone, but I'm never gone from you
It was just the first time
Come back, little boy
Baby, come back, yeah
Little boy
Come back, little boy
Baby, come back, yeah
Little boy
Nothing ever changes, you know it doesn't
Nothing ever changes, ooh, you know it doesn't
Nothing ever changes, you know it doesn't
Nothing ever changes
Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back, yeah
Come back, come back, come back, come back, come backNo one heard her call his name
No one heard a sound she made
They wouldn't have liked it much anyway
To know that she still loves him
No one understands this love
No one ever will
Till his dying day not even he himself can change this
She loves him still
But I miss my friend
I miss the sound of his laughter
She remembers him saying
"Well, where are you going?
Oh, just what is it that you are after?"
No one understands this man
No one ever will
Till his dying day not even he himself can change that
She loves him still
"So how are you?
Have you learned to deal with this?"
"Oh no" she says
"I have not learned
You see, I cannot deal without him"
And the flame still burns
Yes, the flame burns on
No one understands this love
No one ever will
Till his dying day
Not even he himself can change that
She loves him still
No one understands this love
No one ever will
Till his dying day
She was heard to say
She loves him still
And the sands of time like shattering glass go past her
And she still loves him
Oh no, they wouldn't have liked it much anyway
But she still loves him
And the sands of time like shattering glass go past her
Straight back to the sea
Straight back to the sea
Straight back to the seaStevie:
Bruce:Ooh and on you run...
You search for love... and you hate searching
Stevie:You wait for love... and you hate waiting...
You say, "I hate this!"
Bruce:Well it's just another test...
Stevie:'Cause there are two kinds of love
To do the thing that we do the best...
Bruce: My masterpiece...
Who in the world do you think that you are fooling?
Well I've already done everything that you are doing
Well the two of us, well we must be
A great temptation to have even started
Well don't you know, as you walk on by
That great temptations never really die
Stevie: Well I talked to my famous friend last night
My third day up... well, his second nighter
Bruce: He says, "I don't know how you do what you do... how do you
Let the world in?"
Stevie: Well I say, "Well there's no way out... "
Then I just play out the game
Bruce: Well the two of us... Widow and a Dove
Ooh the two of us...
Estranged sometimes for their very survival
Outraged at each other... engaged to each other in their hearts...
But they live apart...
Two kinds of love...
One for the way you walk...
One for the way you love me...
Two kinds of love...
One for the way you walk...
One for the way you love me...Don't keep me hangin' on a string
Tell me what I feel is no big thing
Don't turn away I'm Llstening
Over and over again
Don't give me visions to explain
There are no doubts I feel the strain
Of all my senses yearning
Over and over again
Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on again
Its not important to wonder why
What is just is no more imply
This simple thought repeating
Over and over again
Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on again
Can you imagine all the ways to cope
I close my eyes, that gives my hope
It cures the silence
Every day I see you
Every day I need you
Every way I breath you
On and on and on and on againWould you change your mind at the very last moment
Would you say stop for a second
I'll bet you could think for a minute
In the morning light he says, "When will I see you?"
She says, "I don't think tomorrow, baby"
Sometimes I wonder if things would change if we stayed together
Would you change your mind at the very last minute
I think you should stop for a second
Think for a moment
This could be a whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble
Whole lotta trouble for you
And the angel said, "Well you must have had a dream"
And you remember it till the dream followed through
Till the end of the dream and the dream came true
When I want something, I get it
"You'd better go," he says, "Yes I think I better,"
Stop for a moment I think you should think for minute
Would you change your mind at the very last minute
When I want something, I get it
Not guilty...have mercy
Oh he says, "You could be my prisoner
Well you're not living in the real world"
You're not my friend...you're not my love
And this is something that we really don't discuss
"Where are you?" sometimes I hear you crying
And I wake up and I get through itEvery night you
You tell me everything
Is gonna be fine
You calm my nerves when
You hold my hands
Yea, it feels so fine
I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams
Every night you
You love to hear me sing
It's gonna be fine
You calm my fear down
It's not a problem
No need to cry
I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams
Are all those tears necessary
For all that pain that you carry
You just send those tears away
Come in and out of the darkness
It's a beautiful day
I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams
I'm wishing your wish
I'm wishing my wish
Is gonna come true
I'm just a dreamer
A storyteller
It's all about you
I'm just at the other end of your night
I'm always in and out of your light
Right down the middle of all your dreams
Oooh, in your dreams
Ooh, in your dreams
Aah, in your dreamsWell I heard she flew down to the Mountain City
He said, "That's not what I heard...I hear she went higher."
She depended on her friends to tell herwhen to stop it
To make a statement...this is me talking to you
Like Alice through the Looking Glass...
She used to know who she was
Call out my name...call out my name
But I get no answer...she prays...
"Better run for your life!" cried the Mad Hatter
"Alright," said Alice...I'm going back...
To the other side of the mirror...I'm going back..."
Oh no, you cannot tell a gypsy...ooh, that she's no longer a member
Become a deadly weapon now...along with everything else
Oh call my name...
Like Alice through the Looking Glass...
She used to know who she was
Call out my name 
But I get no answer 
And she prays for the world that she comes from
Each had their own charm...
Buried beneath a solid piece of armour...or a steel plated vest
Some cary a stiletto in their garter along with everything else-
That they carry...Oh, call my name...
Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name 
But I get no answer 
And she prays for the world that she comes from
Alice!...call my name...
"Ooh run for your life..." said the Mad Hatter
"Alright,"said Alice..."I'm going back to the other side of the mirror"
This is me talking to you...well this is me talking to ya
Alice...Alice...Sometimes it rages, rock a little
Even when it's calm, rock a little
Just like the sea, still rock a little
Say it was just like me
Still rock a little
Then you knew her, funny little dancer
And you watched her all night long
You were trying to learn from her teachers
One thing that she wanted
She would not be tangled up
In it
Hit it
It's about time, Lily
Oh, I know, Lily
Rock a little
Hit the stage, dancin'
Hit it
She's gone now
She says I've gone far beyond that song
Rock and roll ballerina
Where else would she go?
He knows his daughter
"Where does she live?"
He says, "Oh, up there somewhere"
Then he says, "Go ahead, Lily
Hit it
Hit it
It's about time, Lily 
Oh, rock on, Lily 
Hit it, hit the stage
Lots of them and all one of a kind
But the most important thing was what was on her mind
Pale pink satin, worn out in a week
But you loved you the most
And you said:
"Go ahead, Lily
Hit it"
No explanations and I tell you "No"
You say nothing
That is how songs are written
Stories are told, rumours are started
Go ahead, Lily
Hit it
It's about time Lily
Hit the stage, dancin'
I know, Lily
Hit it
Hit the stageIt was one for you...it was three for me
It was very nice...it was everything
So here it is..in little pieces...
I just played the part...I didn't win or lose
Maybe next time I'll think about how I'm feeling...
'Cause I'm doing the best that I can
And the whispered secrets...go on and on
No one says anything to anyone
You watch after her...and your word is law
She thought she was out there...but nobody saw
I didn't win or lose...I just threw the cards
But I paid a price for it...
And it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
And I'm trying hard to change...I'm doing the best that I can
Well because fate causes fortune and fortune takes i away
Well it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
I was silent...I was locked away
But I covered my tears...
Silent all day
It's out of my hands here
In my distress...well I wanted someone to blame me
In my devastation...I wanted so to change
In my way...disaster was the only thing that I could depend on...
But it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Yes it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Because fate causes fortune and fortune takes it away
And then fortune cause nightmares...nightmares that make you crazy
It's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
It's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Oh he says. "Well I hear you're doing fine and you're doing the best that you can."
Well he says. "Oh, I hear you're doing fine and you're doing the best that you can."
Ooh she says, "It's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can."
Yes it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Oh and he says, "I hear you're doing fine and you're doing the best that you can."
Oh and he says, "Ooh I hear she's doing fine and she's doing the best that she can."
Oh and I paid a price for it...
I'm doing the best that I can...So where have you gone
Have you gone so far from the eyes that
Speak trouble and even when the warning is
Overwhelming...
Well it's hard to hide from
Eyes that are all over you
That only some
Make you lose your composure
"Well it's hard on my heart"
Said, "Well open your eyes"
"It gets harder every day"
Said, "I need to know now"
Soon you will be gone
Take your violet and blue mornings with you
So you hide out
Like you think that you never left
Tried to tell him that his heart is in his hands
Ten thousand times
I tried to tell you
When you close your eyes
Well I can't see inside you
With the touch of your hand
Well it starts again
Even though the warning is...
So we both play
It gets under your skin
And we both the love the road
But the roads are different
Take it with you
Make you lose your composure...
It's overwhelmingI was born in the desert
So I know how it feels there...
Well look up...it's a shooting star
But it's as black as night...no stars
Well this is the first thing
That I've written
Since I wrote about freedom...
And then the wall came down
Well we thought it was a great,...beginning
People were free to cross the line
But then something happened...in the desert
Something broke the stars...into pieces
Well I live below...a great red mountain
In the shape of a great huge beast
In a place the indians call...Paradise Valley
Well this has always been my sanctuary
I send that to you...too
There on the other side of the world
In the desert...
And we are the guardians
No black clouds...just the faces of you
So where is my father
Where has he gone
Where is my husband
Where is my son
Where is my father
Where has he gone
What is it that happened here
Is it real...This war...
This can't be happening
Ooh well I need to see you
In your...far away war
And you should know...how much we love you They call us here, Operation Desert Angel...
They call us here, Operation Desert Angel...
In waiting...Operation Desert Shield Operation Desert Storm...Operation Desert AngelAnd the rain was there...
There were many nights...
And a few of them, were all that you have dreamed of
Love was the thing...
And you feel as if someone was following you
But you know you are wrong...
It's just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
It's just the ghost of what you really want
And it's the ghost of the past that you live in
And it's the ghost of the future you are frightened of
So you look to you guardian angel
So long ago I was an innocent...
It had nothing to do with age
One day they were lovers...one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say
Well just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
It's just the ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you turn to your guardian angel
And a few of them were all that you really dreamed of
Love was the thing...
So the silver haired girl looks for escapism
To feel the empty spaces she's feeling
She depends on her music like a husband
And she knows it's no good to fall in love again...
One day they were lovers...one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say
It's just the ghost of the past of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
Ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you look to your guardian
So you look...to your guardian angel
Some of them are here on earth
Well some of them are way up there in heaven...
So you look...to your guardian
Some of them are here on earth...
Some of them are...way up there in heaven...heaven...I've been walking under rainbows
Too long to tell
You keep walking down mean streets
My street angel
I try to bring you in
Out of the cold
But street angels live on the street
And they always will
Street angels aren't like anyone you know
They do what they want
And they go where they go
They may tell you
That you hold the world in your hands
But they always give it back
No amount of crying
Changes your mind
No amount of praying
Brings you inside
I know that you love me
And that you always will
You just stand outside and call to me
My sweet street-angel
A Charles Dickens character
With your top hat and your scarf
When you pulled me through the rainbow
I thought you'd stop
But you didn't
You turned around
You went back to the children, and your music
And the people that you love
I can't help but wonder if
Every once in a while
You remember the girl
When you were a homeless angel
That drove you wild
Strange and elusive
No amount of crying
Changes your mind
No amount of praying
Brings you inside
I know that you love me
And that you always will
You just stand outside and call to me
My sweet street-angel
So I ended it all
For the both of us
I fell down the stairs
A broken rag doll
But you never knew
You just thought I went away
With nothing more to hope for
But you don't hear voices any more
No, my sweet street-angelOutside my door the rain is falling
A cold, wild wind will come
Well there's someone for me, somewhere
But I still miss that one
No, I never got over those blue eyes
I see them, everywhere
And I miss those arms that held me
Baby, when all the love was there
Well, I wonder if he's sorry
For ending what we had begun
Well there's someone, someone for me somewhere
Baby, well I still miss someone
And I never got over those blue eyes
I see them, everywhere
And I miss those arms that held me
Ooh baby, when all the love was there
And I never got over those blue eyes
I see them, everywhere
And I miss those arms that held me
Baby, when all the love was there
Baby, when all the love was there
Baby, when all the love was thereCan I be of any help to you, baby?
She says, "Help me, help her, help him too."
Well I made up my mind... I won't be calling
I think about you and...
I think about the heartbroken ones...
It's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world
Well it's a real long way to go... to say goodbye
I thought we already did that
Have fun... tell the world
High in my life... obsessive was my love
Worth it was my time... Oh no, you are fading out
Well I can do it...
Well I can make it one more time
Can I be of any help to you?
She says, "Help him, help her, help him too, baby"
Well I can do it...
Well I can make it one more time
You were high in my life... obsessive was my love
So have fun... tell the world
Oh no, you are fading out
Well can you be of any help to me? 
I don't think so 
Well I can do it
Well I can make it
Well can you be of any help to me? 
Ooooohhh... You were high in my Life...He says to her why do you do it
She says to him why do you stay
Then they say unspoken words to explain it
He says, baby, I hate to see you this way
I hate to see you
I hate to see you cry
Well, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
She will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial
She sits across the table the same glass table
Cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo baby, baby, baby, baby
This is the path you have chosen
She probably goes under another name
Well, that's a good idea
So, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
Well, she will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial Hotel
Who's there
Where has she gone
But, I think she just went home
Sits across the table same glass table
And she cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo, wo, baby oh, my baby
You have to know you have to know
She knows in her heart
That he will stand by her
Anywhere don't cry, baby
I can save you
Don't cry baby, I can save you
She's at the Imperial Hotel
Don't cry baby, I can save youWhen I think about you
I think about how much I
Miss you when you're not around
When I think about you
I think about how much I
Can't wait to hear the sound
Of your laughter
Time and distance never matter
Well I miss you now
I have so many questions
About love and about pain
About strained relationships
About fame as only he could explain it to me
Seems like yesterday
I think about how much I
Wish that you were here with me now
The invisible girl that was my name
She walks in and walks out
And I'm sorry now
I'm sorry now
Well I miss you now
I have so many questions
About love and about pain
About strained relationships
About fame as only he could explain it to me
Tell me again
Paris to Rome, London to Paris
Always goodbye, I nearly couldn't bear it
Her heart settles down
She's back on that staircase
On the way up to her place
I miss you now
I have so many questions
About love and about pain
About strained relationships
About fame as only he could explain it to me
Tell me again
Paris to Rome, London to Paris
Always goodbye, I nearly couldn't bear it
Her heart settles down
She's back on that staircase
On the way up to her place
I miss you now
I have so many questions
About love and about pain
About strained relationships
About fame as only he could explain it to me
I miss you now
Miss you now
Miss you nowIn the beginning she was stunning and pure
When he first saw her he fainted to the floor
She was distant and arrogant from the start
She did not see the fragile state of his heart
She fell in love with him on that very day
She became softer in every way
Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love
So paradise found was not paradise to him
Oh yes he loved her
But he was still an Englishman
Tropical birds and the heat and the ocean
Only drove him crazy
Drove her away from him
Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love
She burned his house down saying
You may have forgotten me
But you'll remember this
You fell to the ground when you saw this
My face, my eyes, my lips
You may have forgotten me
But you'll never forget that kiss
Even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love
When that big house burned down all around her
In the smoke and the fire
In the devastation they never found her
She went back into her red dress
Back to her white house
To her ocean
And after that no words were spoken
About the two of them ever again
And even though they were so in love
They drew a line in the sand just because
They did not know each other
They did not trust
The only thing that they did together
Was to make love
In the beginning
She was stunning, and pure
In the smoke and the fire
Well they never found her
She went back into her ocean
Back to her white house
For awhile they were so in love
For awhile they were so in love
She burned his house down
My face
My eyes
My lips
You may have forgotten that
You may have forgotten that
You may have forgotten that
But you'll never forget that kissRhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life  like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Oh would you even try?
He says, "Rhiannon"
"Don't go"
And he says "Rhiannon"
"Stay"
And he says "I Still cry out for you"
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and
Won't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the sky
Where would you stay if she promised to you heaven
Would you even try?
She is like a cat in the dark
And the she is your darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years you meet a lady like her rises
Oh no rhiannon you cry, and then she's gone
And your life well it knows no answer
And your life knows no answer
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell through the night
And won't you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All you life you've never seen
A woman taken by the sky
Where would you stay if she promised to you heaven
Would you even try?
Would you even try?
And i don't think you'd do
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
And still its hard to find
I had known
Dreams unwind
And still it's still a state of mind I know
Your dreams unwind
And still it's hard to find
Oh you know your dreams unwind
It's still it's a state of mind
Well take me like a wind chime
Take me when sky high
Well take me like the wind chime
Take me when sky high
All they say
All they say
All they say
Rhiannon
All they say
Baby all they say
All they say
Rhiannon
Will you take me with you to the sky high
Dream of heaven
Can I dream of heaven
Dream of, baby dream of
And you still cry out for her
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
NowIt was way too hard...it was way too tough...
On this she had not bargained
But she was like some missionary dancing to the beat of some
Man's ancient drum
And she tries hard to tell this story...but it's a hard one to tell
She consults her book of Miracles...
Cry...and the wind says fly on
Well now you're on your own
You're back out on the road again for a million reasons
Well you're back out on the road again
And you try to tie together some connections...
You get some ribbons and some bows and get back out on the road again
So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her...no one was wrong
But you're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her...a little bit like Juliet
Turn to the blue crystal mirror...was as always it is truthful
Oh, well you see it in the reflection of the real blue lamp
Well tie the connection...get some ribbons and some bows...get back
Out on the road
But when they were good...they were really good...really good strangers
So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her...no one was wrong
You're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her...a little bit like Juliet
Let the crisis become a bridge...and cross that bridge tomorrow
Well let the time that goes between, baby...
Well let it let go of the sorrow
She says "The sky is crying." He says "No, the sky is blue."
He says The sky is not crying." he says "The sky is blue."
She says "The sky is crying." He says "The sky is blue."
Can you get into that?
"The sky is crying..." He says "No, the sky is blue..."A huge fire was burning
And her eyes grew strangely bright
She turned around in her room...
What could she take and still survive the fire?
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion
There is no fire burning...just a soul crying
So cry for me...take a little time...and then stop
It's just something that you cannot see...so stop!
She swings around on the second story...
"I'll get down," she says
Well there is no fire burning...just a soul crying
I will...you know
So I take it to the limit
I will...you know...as I always have
I understand your position...
I withdraw my decision
Well I've got no more information for you
So still there is a fire...that no one sees
She doesn't even see it either...
Or so everyone thinks...
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion...
There is no fire burning...just a soul crying
There's no fire
There is no fire
Well there's no fire burning...just a soul crying...Rhinestone collections all the time
I wonder what Greta would say...
Another lady...another time...
Another heartbroken state of mind
Alone in her chambers...she dreams of her home
Outside...she's got a movie star view
Outcries...well where will the kings go...
Where will the kings go now?
She's got her eyes wide open...
And she's ready to stare you down
She says in words unspoken...she's from out of town
Well some cry...well I really don't dance down
Stormy weather...it cuts like a knife
She's got her bags packed...
And she's off to the valley where the
Sun meets the sea
You understand that...
She wants to live by the ocean...
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains...
The next day...the next day she leaves the station
Do you really want to change her...
Or is it your right?
Ooh...alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
In a very real way...she's the purist art form
I bet she said...just how many art lovers can one
Get to know?
She doesn't have an hour...
She doesn't have five minutes...
She's got to go!
She's got her bags packed...
And she's off to the valley where the
Sun meets the sea
You understand that
She wants to live by the ocean...
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains...
The next day...
The next day she leaves the station
I wonder what Greta would say
Well I wonder what Greta would say
I wonder what Greta would say
Ooh...she's got a movie star view
Oh...well where will the kings go...
Where will the kings go now?
Say Greta..Starshine
Oh you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver
He said "Well this is the price that we would finally pay"
I said "I don't believe you I need you, I need you to stay"
She said "We've been together for so long"
And I said, oh I said
"Playing with fire was"
Oh you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver
Oh, this is the price that we finally pay
I said "No, I don't believe you, I need you, I need you to stay"
She said "We've been together for so long"
Well I said "Playing with fire was, playing with fire was"
Starshine
Ooh, you used to be silver
Love light, Lover's stare
Well you used to make me shiver
He said "Well baby this is the price that we would finally pay"
And I said "I don't believe you I need you, I need you to stay"
And she said "We've been together for so long"
And I said, and I said "Playing with fire was wrong!"
Playing with fire was
Playing with fire was
Starshine
Oh you used to be silver
Run, run, runaway on down
You make me shiver
Runaway, runaway
Why don't you runaway baby?
I told you what to do with your life but you could not save me
Well, I told you what to do with your life but you could not save me
StarshineI choose to be his confident
And to keep him from the fire
I choose to be quietly discreet
If that is his desire
I touch with gossamar wings
To be quiet around you
There is so much going on
You could easily
Wake up with a stranger
It's not something that you plan
One night in a world of pain
And you finally understand
Not all the king's horses, not all the king's men
Could put it back together
You say you wouldn't do this for very long
The applause from it all is so defining
Well it bounces off the wall at you
When the miracle is happening
High priestess...she's the keeper of the peace in this
Twice as much,intensified
What people will do
To get...this...high
It's not something that you plan
One night in a world of pain
And you finally understand
Not all the king's horses, not all the king's men
Could put it back together
And now alone in my room
As it all begins again 
Was I so wrong
Why am I always so intense 
In this ame place I sit
The same place as before
Well I came all the way here
Just to watch you walk out that door
I didn't ask when you shook your head
I always accepted what you said
As the truth and the truth only
Well it's not enough that you depend on me
And it's not enough that you say you love me
It's not enough to just save face
Because sometimes
You just fall from grace
Sometimes
You just fall from grace
Maybe I am calmer now
Maybe things are fine
Maybe I made the whole thing up
Maybe it isn't a lie
Maybe the reasons I say these things
Is to bring you back alive
Maybe I fought this long as this hard just to make sure you survive
Just to make sure you surviveWell you're a front liner...
You put it all on the line
And you're a gambler...
You turn lucky every time
Ooh, you're consistent...
Hey, and that's good
And you're persistent...
Well I am overcome
Well you're not like anyone else
You're just an instant flash of light
That shines through the night like a lighthouse
Well you're a victim...
Phantom of the opera
And you've been everywhere...
And you live in dark shadows
You do what you want to...
There's no Beauty and the Beast here
No...no...no...
There's no Beauty and the Beast here
Well you're not like anyone else
You're just an instant flash of light
That shines...
Well open up the window...
And you will hear the rain
Come back to me once more...
And throw away the pain
My world will still revolve around you
Take time...to listen to the rain
Take time baby...to listen to the rain
Well she didn't know then that the sound that she heard
Was the sound of her own door...closing
Open up the window...
And listen to the rain
Take some time to smell the roses...
And you can throw away the pain
My world will still revolve around you
Take time baby...to listen to the rain
Take time...and listen to the rain
Well take time...and listen to the rain
Ooh take time honey...take a little time honey
Take time...to listen to the rain
(Take time baby...a little time baby...
And listen to the rain)Baby how much closer could we be
I swear you've become a part of me
You are with me everywhere I go
If you feel it I already know
Everything I say to you is true
I don't want to tell you what to do
But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I were you
I would trust in me like I trusted in you
Oh, if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know what you're dreaming when you sleep
You have secrets I will always keep
And in every morning when we arise
I see my reflection in your eyes
Every boy must learn to be a man
Maybe I can help you, yes I can
But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I were you
I would trust in me like I trusted in you
Oh, if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I believe that love is a living thing
Born into our destinies
From a single moment of inspiration
And as it grows it changes your life forever!
But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I were you
I would trust in me like I trusted in you
Oh, if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohI love to waltz with a man in a dark linen suit
All alone -- at a party with someone I knew
From a time gone by -- turned to stone
You could be Garbo or even Marlene
You could be Marilyn...
Or you could forget
I play the part but then all of us do
And I do it so well as I do it to you
In this town full of strangers
In this town full of fools
Venus doesn't glitter when she stands next to you
When you're waltzing through stardom
You miss what you lose
Lose yourself in a silvery dress
For you think you must do what you feel you do best
And you musn't give it up for you're still but a guest
You could be Garbo or even Marlene...
Or you could forgetLike the eyes to the soul
From across the room
And the crowd fades away
And we stand alone
Just like nothing's changed
After all these years
But it's still the same
And you're not to blame
No you're not to blame
Well, my heart still stops
When I stand before you
And my heart still breaks
When you take my hand
And my eyes still close
When someone speaks your name
And you understand
It's all the same
And the first sign of life
Well it lifted my heart
As if some kind of wings
Came and lifted me up
And so became your face, your name
After all these years
It's all the same
And you're not to blame
Well, my heart still stops
When I stand before you
And my heart still breaks
When you take my hand
And my eyes still close
When someone speaks your name
And you understand
Well my heart still stops when
When I stand before you
And my heart still breaks
When you take my hand
And my eyes still close
When someone speaks your name
And you understand
My heart still stops
When I stand before you
And my heart still breaks
When you take my hand
And my heart still cries
When someone speaks your name
And you understand
Oh, my heart still stops
When I stand before you
Yes, and my heart still breaks
When you take my hand
And my eyes still close
When someone speaks your name
It's all the sameWell, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I try to dance with
What life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain
There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees
My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain
My head in my hands
Down on my knees
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
I've reached in darkness
And come out with treasure
I've laid down with love
And I woke up with lies
What's it all worth
Only the heart can measure
It's not what's in the mirror
But what's left inside
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
You gotta take it as it comes
Sometimes it don't come easy
I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
And I've cried a river of tears
From the pain
I tried to dance with
What life had to hand me
And if I could
I'd do it all over again
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind
And sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses
And sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes the picture
Just ain't what it seems
You get what you want
But it's not what you need
Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
Well it's a breeze
It's a breeze, it's a breezeHow do expect to be here for you baby
I really don't care
You've never down much for me
And this is my cross to bear you say
"I Don't Care"
I just care of hard work I've owed you anywhere
How would my life be without you in it
I Don't Care!
Getting in the way of my life is enough for me
And one more time I see you can cause anxiety 
"I Don't Care"
Well I do care baby!
Why do you question me?
So how should I care when you go to leave me?
I don't care at all
I Don't Care!
Of how hard work I've owed you anywhere
Lost outside of this baby
In trouble again
For the wrong things
I didn’t know him
He didn’t know me
There she goes again
Ooh, she says
“Do you think that this could be one?”
I don't care 
I don't care 
She sees no evil, she is in love!
He speaks no evil, he speaks love
I've done so much baby why do I care?
You go out and leave me alone
You come home angry scream and shout
You say you don't love me...
So how should I care when you go to leave me?
I don't care at all
I Don't Care!
Of how hard work I've owed you anywhere
Lost outside of this baby
I Don't Care!
I Don't Care!
I Don't Care!
I Don't Care!Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby, nothin' else mattered
He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of...seventeen
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly familiar
And I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and the voice from a choir
And a melody, nothing else mattered
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colours, but the sea
Does not change
And so with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age old desire to please
On the edge of...seventeen
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Well then suddenly there was no one
Left standing in the hall
In a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing "Come away" 
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
Sometime to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
 my love
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whooWhat would I do
For just some time with you
What will you do
When the thrill is gone, baby
Oh where have you gone
Have you gone so far from me
Leaving your touch
On the edge of my heart
What will I do
In the thrill of the night, baby
Don't give that to her
You remember my words
All the beautiful worlds
That I have seen so far
Have all fallen down
Ooh it used to be yours
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
I see through your smile
And I see through the heart of you
I know where it goes
And I know what it means
Well I know where you go
To the edge of the night, baby
Don't give that to her
Baby give that to me
All the beautiful worlds
That I have seen so far
Have all fallen down oh
It used to be yours
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
You say you're leaving baby
You don't want to tell me why
And after all this time you think you
You don't even say goodbye ooh
Oh you say you're leaving, baby
And you don't want to tell me why
After all this time you think you
Don't even say goodbye
I see through that smile
And I see through the heart of you
I know where you go
To the edge of the night, baby
All the beautiful worlds
That I have seen so far
Have all fallen down
Oh it used to be yours
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
Calm, beautiful, child-like victim
Well I see through that smile
And I see through the heart of you
Well I know where you go
To the edge of the night, baby
Well I know where you go
And I know what you do
And I know what you do
'Cause I know where you go
 OhYou may be the one
But you'll never be the one
You think you'll understand
But you don't understand
You may be my love
But you'll never be my love
You may take my hand
You who demands so much
And then there was the kiss
Right out there in the universe
How did that happen
No, it could not have been worse
You forgot yourself
It could not have been worse
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child
You may have the question
But you'll never answer to me
You may have the goodness somewhere
But you'll never let me see
You may be the righteous one
But it won't be right for me
How it's lasted so long
It's a mystery to me
I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child
You may cry the tears
But the tears aren't really for me
You say it's taken years
Years of regret and pain
Forget me not
He says I'm so afraid
He says there's no fear in your eyes
Tell me another lie
I hear the islands calling
I hear angry words
Flying across the ocean
Like some sea birds
Never stopping
I feel my blood racing
I can't believe what you are saying
I used to love you so much
I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
I used to love you
See the light inside of you
I used to dream that
You were an angel
You were an angel
And I was a starving child
And we were magicThough deep set and somewhat shadowed
Her life... her mystery
Well it's not so different than the way that he said
"So don't hide your eyes from me that way, baby"
In his heart he wishes her stardom
His eyes want for her much more
That's not so different
Than the way that he said
"There are so very few stars left"
Don't hide behind your hair
It's a bit of gold and braid
Easy come the tears
You see a pathway ending with a doorway
You slip toward the doorway
Been waiting there all day
All these years
Don't hide it
In his heart, he wishes to forget her
Like to make her better
And to hold her like a child
Don't hide your eyes that way
Don't hide anything not anymore
Because I never did not love you
I never did run from you
In a dream I said to you
That I'd always love youHe's a castaway
He knows I don't really see him
I could leave today
Stand alone
Watching the water
You go 'round and 'round
But it just gets harder
'Round and 'round
But it's not that easy
Livin' in a hole
Was it your world or just my darkness?
Nowhere to go, you know
There are angels running from the heartless
He's a castaway
He knows I don't really see him
I could leave today
But I could never offer freedom
Was it your world or just my darkness?
There are angels running from the heartless
Playing down the road
In your mystery
Changes... mystery
Changes in your mystery
Changes in your mystery...
Changes...
Talking 'bout your mystery...
Mystery... changes...Dreams reoccur in my solitude
Breaking my heart
Injuring my mood
With all of the things that I thought I knew
It was you
Well the conversation rings in my head
Well you know me better than I know myself
Can you write this for me
He says no, you write your songs yourself
That made me stronger
It made me hold on to me
Well, I remember
You caught my eye
It was late September
It was no suprise
He made me better
His songs were soft and tender sometimes
Well the conversations ring in my head
I remember everything that we said
All those tears that we shed
Well you know me better than I know myself
Can you write this for me
He says no, you write your songs yourself
That made me stronger
It made me hold on to me
The conversations ring in my head
I remember everything that we said
All those tears that we shed
Don't call me when you're lonely
Well you know me better than I know myself
Can you write this for me
He says no, you write your songs yourself
That made me stronger
It made me hold on to me
Well once more I tell the shadows of my soul
To stay back
Everything has changed now
And I don't want to go back
And nothing you can say can change my mindThe rose stood out
Red against the golden wall
The sun comes through the silken drapes
The room begins to glow
All in cream-colored ivories
And soft yellows
You say hello
Put down that guitar and handed me a rose
At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls
The sun fades out
And the mountains grow tall
The mists rush in and they take it all
From the islands you see
Li Galli and Capri
I remember it all
Love was everywhere
You just had to fall
At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls
At the end of the Italian summer
It rains fast and it rains hard
The wind blows right through you
It tears you apart
Ooh it's so romantic
Hey it's so soulful
The rain falls down
And the thunder rolls
The sun fades out
And the mountains grow tall
Then the mists rush in
And they take it all
From the islands you see
Li Galli and Capri
I remember it all
You just had to fallYou've got your ball
You've got your chain
Tied to me tight tie me up again
Who's got their claws
In you my friend
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock
And sweet you roll
Lost for you I'm so lost for you
You come crash into me
And I come into you
I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream
Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes love it glows so
Im bare boned and crazy for you
When you come crash
Into me baby
And I come into you
In a boys dream
In a boys dream
If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
To forgive me
In my haste
When I'm holding you so girl
Close to me
Oh and you come crash
Into me baby
And I come into you
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
In a boys dream... in a boys dream
Oh I watch you there
Through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
Wear it so well
Tied up and twisted
The way I'd like to be
For you for me come crash
Into meThere is a gate
It can be guarded
Well it is not heaven
And it has a garden
So to the red rose
Grows the passion
And the guardian...
Well it's now you know
It's just a few days...away
It's now you know
And it's then
It's just a game...that...we...play
Someone steals it...
Someone...steals it away
Scares you to death
You don't give in to yourself
You give in to your friends
Don't send an answer
How many times...have you said
Do I love you
Well I always did...everynight
Nobody knows...nothing 'bout it
Well it's now you know
It's everywhere
You say...you seek the truth
I say all is fair
Don't send an answer
How many times...
Have you said...
Do I love you...everynight
Well I always did
Nobody knows...nothin' 'bout it
Wo...do I love you
Well I always did...everynight
Nobody knows...nothin' 'bout it
They know nothing 'bout it
They know nothing' 'bout it...
Do I love you...Ooo
Wo...
Do I love you...Ooo
Do I love you...Ahh
Do I love you...OooIn the beginning I believed in love and things
It happened like a hurricane
I could never really tell you what this did to me
I could never make it better for you
Anyway
Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers
Did it have to be so easy to live without it
I was hoping to remember you with just a smile
Now the memory of giving you is giving out
Well, I could say that I knew it all the while
Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers
Didn't want to be the one to
Say goodbye
In a stranger's eyes
Look how we've changed
I don't really need this in my life
Why don't we forget about it
Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers
Let your soul become a stranger
Baby, you're no stranger
You're no stranger
Not that I am
Well, you've become that stranger
And let your soul become a stranger
Well, you're no stranger not that I am
So you do it I think that you should do it
Well you do itFor all you broken-hearted lovers lost
Go find another one
'Cause you know time won't wait and you'll be late
White rabbits on the run
It's hard to know what's good for you
I know she let you down
But the fever breaks when it's too much to take
So you can put your weapons down
And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend
Never too late to change the pace
Oh how the days creep up on you
And the goodness is something you don't have to chase
'Cause it's following you
And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you now
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh, ooh
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder
It's the owl casting spells that we're under, under
And all I hear is the music
And beauty stands before me
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend
It's in the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, a carousel
A carousel, my friend yeah
Time won't wait, so don't be late
White rabbits on the runI was just that old
That August dark, dark day
Swear that you never saw her face
Swear that you never heard her say
No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything
No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything
What shall I do
What shall I say
Should I say
Who all the things
That I'd like to say to you
No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everyting
Let's make a deal here
Ooh, for one night
Well baby, you fill the night with the
Wind and the rain and the water
Oh, for one night
Well, just for one night
You know that well that
Disasterous sound
Now it will make me wiser
He says, and it will make you look
She says, look out
I don't know how to learn
From the pages of a book
Well I either say too much, or I
I don't say enough
Well I play too hard
Still I'm not tough enough
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything
No spoken word
No small command
What was it she wanted
They said she had everything
Ooh come around tonight indecent
Well
Ah, ha come around
Tonight, indecent baby well
You fill the room
With the rain and the wind and the water
If you tell me
One more time
Oh baby, take it easy
Well, you won't see me ever again
Some people walk down that darkened street
With the faith of a child
And so go the faithless
But after awhile, she says
No spoken word
Let's make a deal here
No small command
What was it she wanted
They said she had everything
Ooh, I don't want to know about itYou say I have everything
Well, I'm living on dreams and chains
But, I sing for the things money can't buy
You say you don't believe
Well could you just look at me
Look deep into my eyes...my love
Well, have you ever been in love
Have you touched the soul of someone
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run
I'll take off my cape for you
I'll take down my hair for you
Anything you want me to do...my love
Well, I'll sit home and wait for you
Oh, darling there's nothing that I'd rather do
Anything you want me to do...my love
Have you ever been in love
Have you touched the soul of someone, baby
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run
You say I have everything
Well, I've been living on dreams and chains
I sing for the things that money can't buy me
Have you ever been in love
Have you touched the soul of someone
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run
Anything...my love
Anything...my love
Any thing...You couldn't wait for answers
You just had to try those wings
And all your happy ever afters
They didn't mean a thing
So I'm not gonna try at all
To keep you from the flame
Just remember not to call my name
When you cry wolf
Once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you anymore
If you start to stumble
If you start to crack
If you're feeling humble
Don't look back
When you cry wolf
Once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you anymore
You can try but you can't get me
Into the fire
'Cause I'm all out of sympathy
And, baby, I can't walk this wire
Find yourself somebody new
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And, baby, that's all
When you cry wolf
Once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you
You cry wolf
Well, once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't see you
So you cry wolf
Once too often
Cry wolf
Oh no, I won't come knockin'
If you cry wolf
I won't see you
'Cause you cried wolfI think I met my match again
Passing 'round the candlelight
In the center of this blizzard
You stood and melted all the ice
Ah, it's only love
Ah, it's only love
Ah, if only love comes round again
It will have been
Worth the ride
You were the master of so many
But saviour to none
I waged all of my hopes so plenty
On you, now look what I've become
Ah, it's only love
Ah, it's only love
Ah, if only love comes round again
It will have been
Worth the ride
Someday's lonely is not only
A word, but faces I have known
And if you see me, could you free me
With a smile, so I can let go
Ah, it's only love
Ah, it's only love
Ah, if only love comes round again
It will have been
Worth the ridePlease God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Spirits all given the strength
Peace can come if you really want it
I had a fragile dream
In a grey house in the Hamptons
I'd been there before
Singing songs and doing benefits
Was in a room alone
Putting on my makeup
Like so many things that come to me
The dress came across the Persian carpet
As I fell into the dress
A thought came to me
Into my heart
I have a dream
And a door opened
I turned to face the music
I was ready for the Kennedy's
I don't know if it was 1960 or 1963
Everything was timeless, even me
I wasn't old, I wasn't young
I was just part of their dream
A shadow walked with me down the hall
It was Martin Luther King
All in shadow, all before me
Overwhelmed by destiny
Someone said, "Sing us a song
There's a piano" and handed me a drink
The room was full of hope
A song would set them free
And I said
Please God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Spirits all given the strength
Peace can come if you really want it
I sat at the piano
Stared out of the shadows
I sang the words, "I have a dream"
He wasn't my old friend John
I didn't know him then
But he smiled at me
And I sang these words
"Whatever it takes
Whatever it takes to be free"
No, I didn't know these men
But they knew me
It was all symbolic
Nothing was as it seemed
They all left us in a single shot
But they didn't take the dream
They were there in that house
Discussing the future
And drinking champagne
I was just a piano player
The voice, part of their dream
I was thirty-five and maybe I was fifteen
It was just another night in the presence of Martin Luther King
I was just a dreamer
I was ready for the Kennedy's
And I said
Please God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Light the fire, start it over
Tell the world about the dream
Start it up and make it real
Please God
Show him the way
Please God
Show her the way
Please God
Show them the way
Please God
Back in the room where it all began
My heart began to heal
I believe it
I remember the beauty of the Hamptons
Shadows playing in the sun
A voice said
"The dream is not over, no
The dream has just begun"
I spun around to see another shadow
Slipping through the door
And my eyes opened wide
"What is this all for?"
And the shadow said
"Don't forget it
Don't forget what we were fighting for
Don't forget it"
And I said
Please God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Spirits all given the strength
Peace can come if you fight for it
Think we're just in time to say
Please God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Spirits all given the strength
Peace can come if you fight for it
Think we're just in time to say this
Set them free
Room was full of hope
Please God, show 'em the way
Please God, on this day
Spirits all given the strength
(Don't forget what
We were fighting for)
Think we're just in time to say
Peace can come
If you fight for it
Peace can come
If you try harder
Peace can come
Ooh, if you really want it
The dream
Don't forget it
Please God
Show them the waySet me free, set me free
Is this what you wanted, to happen to me?
Golden wings in the sunset
Take me back
All alone I waited
But there was no one, out there
There were dreams to be sold 
My 24 karat gold 
There was some love to be sold 
You said you might be coming back to town 
All alone I waited
There was no one out there
In the rain she lay face down
What is this freedom that she wanted
What kind of freedom...
What kind of game?
There were dreams to be sold 
My 24 karat gold  
There was some love to be sold 
You said you might be coming back to town 
Set me free, set me free
Is this what you wanted, to happen to me?
Golden wings in the sunset
Take me back
All alone I waited
But there was no one, out there
There were dreams to be sold 
You like my 24 karat gold, chain of chains
You like my 24 karat gold
Yes you like my 24 karat gold
Yeah
My loveAlright, baby
Well, I think you will like Sister Honey
She will help you
Make up your mind
Even if you don't need her
Tell her you need her
She needs you brother
She needs you brother
Strange fascination
Some kind of temptation
To know Sister
Never having allowed yourself
Do you understand the word, pleasure
Well, you say it's just never crossed your mind
And she believes you
Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying
Nobody's right, baby
All the time
And a fool never knows what he's leaving behind
So take some time to know the real story
Cause a soul that's true is your ride to glory
Don't let that golden hair get in your way , baby
Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying
Come back solemn stranger
It's your last chance
She's almost gone, now
And she'll go fast like a jet plane
And then fast like a star stream
She'll hit you with a fury
Whispering the words one more time, baby
One more time
And she says don't let that golden hair
Get in your way nowThrown down through the arms of sleep
She fell through the ivory morning
Deep into the waters
Of the one she called love
She paled in the wake
Of what some call a dream
But, you cannot know a dream
Till you've known the nightmare
When I stood with you against the storm
And I tried once again
Well, I said, "I'd like to leave you
With something warm"
How many times
Drowning in the sea
Drowning
That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But, the nightmare was not over
Still some call that a dream
The nightmare... the nightmare
Well, you cannot know a dream
When you turn away
You don't know
You'll never care
The night is not your friend
And you have not had her
And when the nightmare ends
But, you never understand
When you're gone
She wakes up calling out
Oh, calling out
As children may cry as she will
Anytime, oh, anywhere
Blinded by the light of the day
She has known the nightmare
So about the moon and her sisters
How dare he take them prisoner
Well, if she had flung out her heart against him
Then in all of her wisdom
Oh, well that was a mystery
That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But the nightmare was not over
Somewhere in her ancient ways
She walks through the night
And then she tries to get through the day
Some will never know
Or share any kind of dream
The nightmare
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the world
The nightmare
She wants him to fight... anytime, anywhere
She wants him to stand up
She wants him to win
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the real world
Blinded by the light of the day
Blinded by the light
She was blinded by the light of the day
Blinded by the dayWhat happened to her
I thought she was here
Through the eyes of love
I saw her through her tears
I saw her smile
I saw her move on
Like a ghost through the fog
The ghost is gone
What happened to them
I thought it was here
Through the eyes of a child
After all these years
He wasn't true
He wasn't clear
Oh no not even to his song
The ghosts are gone
Gone are the ghosts
Now forgotten
Yea...
Gone is the lost world
It's easy to change
Gone are the lost girls
Gone are the lost girls
The girls went home
What happened to them
They opened their doors
They walked right through
They knew it was wrong
Wrong to be swept away
To think they belonged
Now there's only sadness
The boys are gone
Gone are the ghosts
Gone is the lost world. Yea
You're too crazy to change
But never forgotten
Gone are the lost girls
Gone are the lost girls
Gone...
The girls went home
What happened to him
I thought he was here
Through the eyes of love
I saw him through his tears
I saw him smile
I saw him move on
Like a ghost through the fog
A ghost through the fog
Close to the fog
The ghosts are gone
I saw him smile
I saw him move on
Like a ghost through the fog
And the ghost is gone
What happened to him
I thought he was here
Through the eyes of a child
I saw him disappear
He wasn't clear
Not even to his song
The ghost is gone
The ghosts are gone
Ghost thru the fog
Like a silver shadow gone wrong
Like a ghostly whisper she's gone
Like a silvery rainbow
Like a ghost through the fog
Like a ghost through the fog
Like a golden rainbow
Like a golden rainbow
Like a song
Like a ghostly whisper gone wrong
Like a silvery rainbow
Goin' down
Goin' downNobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand outside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately, he sees her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe that I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally finds out she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pills
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear
That I just don't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends
Well, please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Oh, I fake just like a woman, yes, I do
And I make love just like a woman, yes, I do
And I ache just like a woman
But I break, yes, I break just like a little girl
She makes love
She takes love
Oh, but she breaks, yes, she breaks
Yes, she does, and she...
Yes, she does, and she...
Yes, she does...Papa says...there are clothes to wash
Sister says...brush your hair
You'll go down...to the laundromat
Maybe your sister is there
Father says...when you're young like this...
Things can seem...pretty bad
Let's get out...and walk by the river
And there are people who roam the Docklands
And there are ships passing in the night
And there are thousands of things that I have dreamed
Gone in the daylight
Sister says...hold your head up high
Life goes on...so don't be afraid
Keep your defenses...but don't shut the loving out
You got to learn to carry that weight
And all the people who roam the Docklands
And all the ships passing through the night
And there are thousands of things that I have dreamed
Gone in the daylight
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a foreign land
And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Lost in the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to
Hold on...
Hold on...
In the Docklands where I was born...
People keep moving to and fro
Everybody's pushing...trying to make it happen
I...beg of you... I beg of you... I beg of you...
I miss you...more than I thought I could
I need you...more than you know
I was there...when they took you away from me
I'll be there...when they let you go
And then the people who roam the Docklands
And all the ships passing in the night
And the thousands of things that I have dreamed
Stay in the daylight
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a foreign land
And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Well bring me back to the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to
Give me your hand
Give me your hand...
Give me your hand...in the Docklands
I...beg of you...give me your hand...
In the DocklandsCrying in the morning, trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
My destiny says that I'm destined to fall
My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain, unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding
What it was that I was supposed to say
To say to you today
Well, it wasn't like the others, it was nothing at all
It wasn't like anything, it was easy to fall
Love don't mean what it says at all
My destiny says that I'm destined for it all
My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain, unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding
What it was that I was supposed to say
To say to you today
Crying...
Still crying in the morning, trying to be strong
Waiting for the spring to turn into the fall
Love never meant what it said at all
My destiny proved I was destined to fall
My destiny is riding again
Rolling in the rain, unwinding in the wind
My destiny is fighting again
Secretly unwinding
What it was that I was supposed to say
To say to you today
I am crying
I am trying to be strong
Heartbroken
Unspoken
You were nothing like the others
You were nothing like the others
Heartbroken
Unspoken
All gone
Nothing left at all
Heartbroken
Unspoken
I am trying to be strong
I am trying to be stong
Nothing, nothing changed at all...At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song 
At last
The skies above are blue
Well my heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
And you smiled, you smiled 
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
And you smiled, you smiled 
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last 
You are mine
You are mine
At last
At last
At last
At lastYou used to call me wicked
I used to call you friend
They say your life is wild
Compared to what...lifestyle
You must have many things...to remember
Cause nothing else in your life has really changed
Everything is almost...like it was before
And I don't want to do this...anymore
When you lose your sight 
And there's nothing to see 
She was just like me 
And suddenly...the day comes
Some call it love...
Some say they're above that
Well I believed in love...
I called it worth it
Some call me...all the time 
Well love is like a river 
And when you lose your sight
And suddenly...the day comes
Everything all around me is electric now
But I haven't burned a candle in a real long time
And only when your heart says it's over does it die
Well love is like a river...running...
Straight back to the sea
Some call it love...
Some say they're above it...
Well I believed in love...
I called it worth it......
Well some call me all the time
I say you can't stay home and give up the fight
I think you're uptight lady...ooh, out of sight
That's just what I wanted to hear...ooh, out of sight
You know you can't stay home
In the middle of the night
Love is like a river
You can't say no in the middle of the night
I think you're uptight lady...ooh, out of sight
And you can't say no in the middle of the night
Love is like a river
Well I think you're uptight lady...uptight lady...
Ooh, out of sight...out of sight, babyYou've left me now
And it's seasoned my soul
And with every step you take
I watch another part of you go
I continue to build a wall
You were so strong
I fell to my knees
And I don't think I can handle this at all
Well one more night
I'd like to lie and hold you
Yes and feel
To make you smile
I'd like to be there for you
Have you forgotten me?
And the days go by
Doing nothing about them
How much time
Will I have to spend?
My mind won't rest
And I don't sleep
Not even in my dreams
If you ever did believe
For my sake
If you ever did believe
And the days go by
Doing nothing about them
How much time
Will I have to spend?
And the days go by
Doing nothing about them
How much time
Will I have to spend?
Well one more night
I'd like to lie and hold you
Yes and feel
To make you smile
I'd like to be there for you
Have you forgotten me?
Ooo....Ooo.....Ooo...
Baby don't leave me
Ooo..Ooo...Ooo...Ooo
I'm down on my knees...
Ooo..Ooo...Ooo...Ooo
Begging you please...
Ooo...Ooo...Ooo...Ooo
Baby don't leave me...Wake up my sweet child
There's something I've got to say to you tonight
It's time you took a look at me
'Cause there's so much more to me than meets the eye
Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look the more you'll find
It's never easy - no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play
The heart's the price you pay
Love's a hard game to play
No matter what they say
Win or lose, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play
The problem here is not my fear
The trouble is you can't convince yourself
For tonight, let's lose the past
Make love last - Put our worries up on the shelf
We've been through thick and thin, and back again
And we can endure love's sweet pain
Remember, starting the fire is easy
The hardest part is learning how to keep the flame
Love's like walking a real fine line
You get too close and you'll go blind
Let go too long and it will drift away
Love's a hard game to play
The heart's the price you pay
Love's a hard game to play
No matter what they say
Win or lose, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play
Just when I feel like I'm losin' you
I hear the voices call
They say it's better to have lost at love
Than never to have loved at all
Lose or win, stand or fall
Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look, the more you'll find
It's never easy, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play
A hard game to playJust like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby, nothin' else mattered
He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of...seventeen
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly familiar
And I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and the voice from a choir
And a melody, nothing else mattered
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colours, but the sea
Does not change
And so with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age old desire to please
On the edge of...seventeen
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Well then suddenly there was no one
Left standing in the hall
In a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing "Come away" 
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
Sometime to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
 my love
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whooAnd when she walked in the room
After so many years
He looked up and saw her
He was standing at the crossroads
She was moving in slow motion
Everything was the same
Except that everything was different
In that very moment, everyone was silent
And everyone was friendly
For the first time in years
Everyone was smiling
Though their pain was apparent
And the floor was wet and slippery
With the tracks of their tears
And when I see someone standing
At the side of the stage
Not standing in the shadows
I see her face
Glowing in the darkness
In her own angel way
"I have come to make you better
I have come to take you away."
No one slipped and fell
This time, everyone was steady
Someone held my arm so that
I would not fall
For the fist time, in a long time
Everyone was ready
No one said a word
And that simply said it all
And then I see someone standing
At the side of the stage
Not standing in the shadows
I see her face
Glowing in the darkness
In her own angel way
"I have come to make you better
I have come... to take you away."
I'll make you better
Walking through the room together
In suspended animation
No one saw us go, no one said goodbye
But in my heart I leave
Great expectations
That you will find the answers
To your questions
And that life will once more
Be a celebration
And that you will be touched by an angel
And that you will be touched by an angel
And that you will be touched by an angel
Celebration
Someday
Someday, someday
CelebrationShe was so enticed
By his smile
She was so unaffected
By his dream
For his dream of her
Was just not possible
She was so not that girl
It was just one of those things
That happened or didn't happen
A strand of golden hair tangled
Like the words of a song
Like a spider's web
And then he said
Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one
She was so enchanted by his voice
She was so shaken by his words
His plan for her...
Was just not possible
She had no words...
Ooh it isn't just that
We cause each other such pain
Everywhere we go now
At home or on stage
Sometimes it was heavenly
Sometimes it was too heavy
I looked the other way
Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one
Don't come here again
Unless fear of fire leaves you cold
And the cold makes you tired
If you feel it all
It's all about desire
About when you were true
About a bird on a wire
And that was you
She does still hear him
All night long
The same song over and over
It heals her heart
No voice of a stranger
Could play that part
It broke her heart
Broke her heart
Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only oneWhat's cheaper than free
You and me
What's better than alone
Going home
What does money not buy
You and I
What's not to feel
When love is real
What's faster than a fast car
A beating heart
What's deeper than a deep well
The love into which I fell
More important than freedom
Being needed
More exciting than high fashion
High passion
What's brighter than a smile
You child
You child
What's brighter than a smile
You child
You child
You child
You child
What's warmer than a sun drenched land your hand
Your hand
Your hand
