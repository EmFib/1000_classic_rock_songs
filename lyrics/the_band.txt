I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand
And "No" was all he said
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And  you put the load right on me
I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil
Walking side by side
I said "Hey Carmen, come on
Let's go downtown?"
And she said, "I gotta go
But my friend can stick around"
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And  you put the load right on me
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?"
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And  you put the load right on me
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And  you put the load right on me
Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And  you put the load right on meIf I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearlsKaybet bu öfkeni
İçinde sakladığın
Terk et o derdini;
Benden almadığın
Sabret, sonu aynı değil!
Söylüyorum
Dinle, rüyaların her gün aynı
Olmayacak!
Şimdi vazgeçersen geriye döneceksin
Gitme! Kaybedince daha çok seveceksin
Biliyorum, hiçbir anlamı yok:
Yokluğunda, yokluğunda, yokluğunda
Kaybet bu öfkeni

Yokluğunda, yokluğunda, yokluğunda...Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream
I hear the south wind moan
The bridges getting lower
The shrimp boats coming home
The old man down in the Quarter
Slowly turns his head
Takes a sip from his whiskey bottle
And this is what he said
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans
Man came down from Chicago
He gonna set that levee right
He said, "It needs to be at least three feet higher
"It won't make it through the night"
But the old man down in the Quarter
He said "Don't you listen to that boy
"The water'll be down by the morning
"And he'll be back to Illinois"
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans
Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream

Nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans, yeahGive me a second light
I haven't smiled since yesterday
If I need to I can pay
But let me hold this 'til I feel okay
Since you burned me at the stake
All of my feelings went away
There’s no feelings in my way
At least there’s no feelings in my way
I was there when you were blind to everything that I could see
I'll pretend that it's just me
But maybe really it's just me
I forgot what it was like to think I found you finally
What if you were the one for me?
I hope you weren't the one for me
And I know this
I can’t read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
I still need you
Give me 'til 23, I’ll need another year for this
Trying to teach my common sense to not waver with my confidence
Traded my soul to free my mind, car mix to help me pass the time
Can I go back to being blind?
Asked myself why one too many times
And I know this
I can’t read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
I still need you
I tried to say thank you, but I don't know if you heard me
I know it wasn't your plan, to just be the one that hurt me
My thoughts versus my feelings
My thoughts on you hit the ceiling
But my feelings aren't a real thing
If I feel things I don't really discern
And I know this
I can’t read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
And I know this
I can’t read it right, between the fights
I still need you
And I know this
I fell for your eyes, I just realized
I still need you
I still need you
I still need you
I still need you
I still need you:
Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
:
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"
:
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee"
Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"
Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"Well, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble on the promenade
And the gamblin' commissioner's hangin' on by the skin of his teeth
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Well, I got a job and I put my money away
But I got the kind of debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew out what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
We'll be goin' out where the sand turns to gold
But put your stockings on, 'cause it might get cold
Oh, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Now I've been a-lookin' for a job, but it's hard to find
There's winners and there's losers and I'm south of the line
Well, I'm tired of gettin' caught out on the losin' end
But I talked to a man last night, gonna do a little favor for him
Well, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Oh, meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Oh, meet me tonight in Atlantic CitySecond guess these words of mine
I always thought that I'd be fine with you
But ever since we crossed that line
Got your green eyes in the back of my mind, it's true
But I can't be just friends
You're messing with my head
And I know what I said but
These feelings they keep running the red
I got your heart on my mind and
You said that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got, your face on my mind and
It was fun, running around for a while
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
Two steps forward, one step back and
It won't be long 'fore my heart's attached 
And common sense falls second place
To the way it feels when you kiss my face 
But I can't be just friends
You're messing with my head
And I know what I said
But, these feelings they keep running the red
I got your heart on my mind and
You said that I could come by anytime
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
I got, your face on my mind and
It was fun, running around for a while
But I can't, I can't fall in love tonight
I can't fall in love tonight
Oh, I can't fall in love tonight
Can't fall in love, yup!Call it what you need
But don't blame yourself for me
Don't blame yourself for me
'Cause I spaced myself from you
'Cause I got tired of hurting you
But now I'm hurting too
Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want
But I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, or call it right
But don't call it off
Just call the black and white
I call it how I see
But you care way too much for me
And I can't stand that honestly
So I pushed it all away
'Cause I won't let you see me this way
But still, I'd wish you stay
Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want
But I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, or call it right
But don't call it off
Just call the black and white
Head back to where I've been
And my mind is wearin' thin
I'll stare at your name
But I'm far from dialin'
I want to lay it on the line
But all your calls, decline
This isn't black and white
Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Call it what you want
'Cause I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, or call it right
But don't call it off
Just call me, call me, call me
Call it a rivalry, call it a fight
Oh, call it what you want
'Cause I need you tonight
Call it a waste of time, or call it right
But don't call it off
Just call the black and whiteI don't wanna talk about it
And I think we both know why
I wish it wasn't automatic
The way I want you every time
'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to
Can't think straight since you've been gone
I saw someone out in your go-to outfit
Right when I thought I was on
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you
I hesitate to say the ocean
Could hold a candle to your eyes
You shut the door and cut me open
Now I'm wishing I was colorblind
'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to
Right when I thought I was on
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of you
You've got me off track
Got me thinkin' abstract
Baby, look at what you've done
Still you've got me wantin' some
Body on body contact
I love it, but I hate that
Black jeans and Daphne blue
Still make me think of youWhen I get off of this mountain
You know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi River
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor
I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough, she had won
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea
He-he!
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk"
Now that just gave my heart a throb
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
No-no, hu-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
No-no-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
Now there's a flood out in California
And up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know deep down, I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
No-no, hu-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
No-no-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
No-no-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
No-no-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-huThought that I'd forget about it
But I can't seem to kick the habit
I can't hear over all this racket
Never shoulda called, so just go and tell your friends about it
I said some things I wish I hadn't
I wish that we could talk about it
Don't think I can live without you, bangin' on your door
Screamin', "You're the only way I'll have it"
When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time
Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do
I still have your denim jacket
The one with the Madonna graphic
I sit around and pout
See it layin' on the couch 'cause I guess you just forgot to pack it
Everyone I've asked about it
Has said you're doin' fine, I doubt it
So go ahead and laugh about it, bangin' on your door
Screamin', "You're the only way I'll have it"
When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time
Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do
So much on my mind 
Back in ninety-five 
All I seem to find is a universe of thought 
I'm sorry I cannot 
They're all here to stay so I'll take one on the chin 
Better than I've been 
I guess that all depends, can I find a way alone? 
'Fore my time runs out 
You're the only way I'll have it
When I find you
I hope you change your mind
Less than I do
But maybe I'll change this time
Are you lonely?
I can only
Hope you feel blue
Less than I do
I hope you feel blue
Less than I do
Less than I do
Less than IYou were always searching for deliverance
Blatant misconceptions that you make
My overall perception of this dream
Is that I'll die before I wake
At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine
You were always certain that it did exist
Imagination so intrinsic all at stake
All the things we said when we were younger
Did it bend or did I break
At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine
Wait for me, wait for me there
I'll die if you die, wait for me I swear
Wait for me I'm still somewhere
You're getting older and I'm getting scared
Wait for me, wait for me there
I'll die if you die, wait for me I swear
Wait for me I'm still somewhere
You're getting older without me, I'm scared
At another place in time
You were infinitely mine
Relatively alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fine
At another place in time
Only parallel to mine
The universe was alright
When Berenstein was fineSecond chances, they don't bother me
Time's the only track to honesty
I know it's not how I was raised to see
But I don't care who you want me to be
You told me to lie, but I won't
It doesn't seem right knowing
I'll never get what I want if I can't on my own
I took a chance on a feeling
But here I am feeling alone
I talked to my friends yesterday
Turns out they all hate you anyway
I wondered why it took so long to clear
They only tell me what I want to hear
You told me to lie, but I won't
It doesn't seem right knowing
I'll never get what I want if I can't on my own
I took a chance on a feeling
But here I am feeling alone
You told me to lie, but I won't
It doesn't seem right knowing
I'll never get what I want
Never get what I want
Never get what I want
Never get what I want
Never get what I wantLet me tell you about Petah Tikva
Such a city, everybody loves it!
Lots of fun, lots of art, lots of culture
That's Petah Tikva, with a "P"
Where you are, this is not Petah Tikva
Such a city, nobody knows it!
Not a fun, not an art, not a culture
This is Bet Hatikvah, with a "B"
Like in "boring"
Like in "barren"
Like in "bullshit"
Like in "bland"
Like in "basically bleak and beige and blah, blah, blah..."
Stick a pin in a map of the desert
Build a road to the middle of the desert
Pour cement on the spot in the desert
That's Bet Hatikvah
Welcome to Nowhere!
Behold, where there was once only desert is the town of Bet Hatikvah. See, apartments! Gaze upon my cafe! While you're here, be sure to go back and forth between my cafe and the apartments. So much to explore!
Pick a sand hill of your choosing
Take some bricks that no one's using
Build some buildings, put some Jews in
Then blah, blah, blah...
Bet Hatikvah!
Here you are, in renowned Bet Hatikvah!
Go ahead, look around Bet Hatikvah!
Lucky you, you have found Bet Hatikvah!
Welcome to Nowhere!
With a "B"!
Welcome to Nowhere!I spend too much time in my room
I keep too many secrets from you
I like to be alone but it's bad for me
'Cause I spend too much time in my room
I spend too much time on my phone
I know I've said I liked bein' alone
But I care way too much about what they think
So I spend too much time on my phone
My mama don't like my tattoos
So I had to act like I do
The only thing that I learned in school
Is life treats you well if you're cool
I spend too much time in my head
Wish I could say what needs to be said
But no one seems to care about honesty
So I spend too much time in my head
My friends, they all smoke cigarettes
By Wednesday I'll be smoking one too
My brother said he don't know me anymore
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Sometimes I still think about you
I don't tell you all the things I used to
Don't like to admit that it's bad for me
But I spend too much time in my roomIs this a hymn?
Is this a love song?
Something ancient by a poet
Maybe Hafiz, maybe Rumi?
Is he singing about two hearts searching in the darkness?
Or is he singing about fishing?
The tune seems sad, but are the words sad?
What's he saying? Is he praying?
And why does it get to me?
Is he lonely? Maybe reaching out for someone?
Look at me. Maybe I'm the one who's fishing
Every day you stare to the west, to the south
You can see for miles, but things never change
Then honey in your ears, spice in your mouth
Nothing's as surprising as the taste of something strange
And here's this man
Right here beside me
Kind of deep and kind of cute
In his Sargeant Pepper suit
Is this my sheikh?
Is this my Omar Sharif?
Well, I know it's something different
Itgara'a...
Who is this man right here beside me?
Closer by an inch or two, my cheek would touch his ear
What is he thinking? What does he wish for?
Is he singing about wishing?
Something new I've never seen before
Through these walls I build, these gates I protect
Something new I didn't notice I was hoping for
Nothing is as beautiful as something that you don't expect
Look at those hands
Those are not young hands
But they move like they are swimming through the music
Through the music
And I don't know what I feel
And I don't know what I know
All I know is I feel something different
Itgara'a...
He makes me feel something differentThe higher I climb the farther I fall when I do
I guess I'll take this loss on my wasted obsession with you oh
I thought that I'd finally found something worth seeing through
Now you only remind me of someone I thought that I knew
I'll never fall how I fell when I saw you
And I'll never feel how I felt when I called you
And I'll never tell what I told you to anyone else
How did I let you make me make a fool of myself
It makes me sick you know more than my friends about me
It hurts like hell 'cus I only fell for some girl you pretended to be
You're a much better liar than anyone I've met before no
Now I just need some time till I don’t cry about you no more
I'll never fall how I fell when I saw you
And I'll never feel how I felt when I called you
And I'll never tell what I told you to anyone else
How did I let you make me make a fool of myself
I'll never fall how I fell when I saw you
And I'll never feel how I felt when I called you
And I'll never tell what I told you to anyone else
How did I let you make me make a fool of myselfI don't know, with the girls, I don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
I'm smarter up here than I am down here
And up here, I'm not too smart
They might say one thing or another
They might have smiled at me once or twice
If they have breasts and they're not my mother
Then all I hear is- 
And the hands get heavy, oh the hands
I don't know what to do with the hands or the feet
Frozen in fear like a deer with the lights
In their eyes in the middle of the street
She might be wanting to get touchy-feely
She might be talking to me really nice
She might as well be speaking Swahili
'Cause all I hear is- 
And my tongue gets big
And I can't move my knees
And my eyeballs freeze
And all I see's a tunnel
And there's cotton in my head
My legs are full of lead
And my brain goes deader than the Dead Sea
Dead, dead
Dead in the mind and I find that I kind of
Go into an infantile trance
I'm peeing in my - not literally - peeing in my -
But, you know, I may as well be - peeing in my -
Then I lose my wits
And my lights go off
I get all sticky in the pits
And I smell like falafel
And my ears get hot
And I feel real awful
And all I hear is-
Dead, dead, dead!
Belly up, going round
Sinking down, down, down
Like a schmuck
Dead in the head
Dead in the water
Dead in a magical sea
Full of suck!
Go ahead and tell me I should keep on trying
Go ahead and tell me I should break the ice
I'll be standing here, deaf and dying
And all I'll hear is...I still see your silhouette
I wish we’d never met
I’m living with the ghost of you
You still visit me in bed
Got visions in my head
It’s like I’m having déjà-vu
I still hear you in the hallway
Voices calling my name
Tell me what you want from me
White noise coming from the TV
Nobody believes me that
It felt like the beginning
At least it did to me
And it is what it is
And it’s just what it will be
She’s all that I wanted
She’s so unreal to me
And now this house is haunted
She’s just make-believe
Maybe it was all a dream ‘cause
That’s the way it seems
A flicker in the dark again
I feel like such a lonely creature
Don’t know how to reach her
Don’t know how to tell my friends that
I’m caught up in my delusion
Drown in my confusion
They will think I’m losing it
White noise coming from the TV
Nobody believes me that
It felt like the beginning
At least it did to me
And it is what it is
And it’s just what it will be
She’s all that I wanted
She’s so unreal to me
And now this house is haunted
She’s just make-believe
You’re still here even though you’re gone
You disappear when the lights come on
You’re still the one that I dream about
Now I’m stuck in a nightmare and I can’t get out
Hear you say my name
Feel you touch my skin
Know it’s all in my head
But I keep giving in
You were the one I always wanted
You were the one that left me haunted
White noise coming from the TV
Do you believe me yet?
She’s all that I wanted
She’s so unreal to me
And now this house is haunted
She’s just make-believeClouds so swift, rain won’t lift
Gate won’t close, railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain’t goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!
I don’t care how many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money and pack up your tent
You ain’t going nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to the tree with roots
You ain’t going nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!
Genghis Khan, he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We’ll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!Waiting. What's new here?
You're waiting, I'm waiting
'Cause that's what we do here
Same as we do every day
For something, I don't know, to happen
No, just something different to happen
Just waiting for something to change
Just a change
Sometimes it feels like we're moving in a circle
Around and around with the same scenery going by
But no one's complaining
We're experts at waiting
Oh...
Ah...
Time's like a river sometimes
Time's like an ocean
The sofa is my boat
And I'm just drifting right along
Time is like syrup
And I'm the bug stuck
In the syrup
Just kind of trying to find out
What I'm doing wrong
Just waiting for something
To happen, for
Anything to happen
Waiting to find out
What I'm doing wrong
Ah...
Ah...
You know what I think?
There's two kinds of waiting
There's the kind where you're expecting something new
Or even strange
But this kind of waiting, you keep looking off out into the distance
Even though you know the view is never going to change
You wait....
Waiting, for something
For anything to happen
Just waiting for anything to
Wait...She was in a white dress
With red and purple ribbons in her hair
She was dancing with somebody
But in love and music, all is fair
We were finishing "The Girl from Ipanema"
Going into "Summertime"
I was in the middle of my solo
When her eyes met mine
Love starts on a downbeat
Love starts when the music starts
Love starts when the tune is sweet
And you lift your feet
To the beat of your heart
Love makes a rhythm
Love dances in a dancer's shoes
It moves when you start to move
And what is the groove?
The beat of your heart!
And we played "Moon River"
And "I Want to Hold Your Hand"
And the girl in the white dress
And the ribbons in her hair
Danced to my band
And I could feel my heart
It started jumping in my chest
And I smiled at her
And she smiled at me
And the music did the rest
Love sparks on the upbeat
Igniting with a minor 9th
Resolving to a major 6th
Then something clicks
And everything starts
There goes the kick drum
Spelling out the rhythm of love
Telling you get off your seat
And move your feet
And dance to the beat of your heart
And if you play me "Summertime"
And if I stop and close my eyes
I'll see an angel swirling, moving
Young and so alive
This music is a time machine
This music is a gift from God
Her face was beautiful
My God, her face was beautiful
So maybe I'm romantic
Maybe I'm a sentimental fool
Maybe music is the food of love
But music and love, who can tell them apart?
Just let me hear the downbeat
Let me hear the downbeat
And let me hear the bah, bah, bah!
Bah, bah, bah!
Let me hear you kick the kick
And whack the snare
And shake your ass
And stir up the air
And dance with the girl with the ribbons in her hair
Embracing the rhythm of love
That's exactly the same as
The beat of your heart
The beat of your heart...
The beat of your heart...
The beat of your heart!I caught your eye across the room
No one can feel the tension between me and you
There's no need to mention all the things I wanna do
You wanna do them too
We both know we'd be over if they knew
Yeah, we both know we'd be over if they knew
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
We'll both be better off if no one knows
Hush, hush
Got nothin' to say
Just keep it to yourself 'til we get home
Don't touch they're looking your way
If anybody asks, we left alone
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
I need you to pick me up
'Cause my car in your drive is way too obvious
It's 2:45 am we're finally all alone
All our friends went home
I can finally lay you down and let it show
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
We'll both be better off if no one knows
Hush, hush
Got nothin' to say
Just keep it to yourself 'til we get home
Don't touch they're looking your way
If anybody asks, we left alone
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Hush, hush
Got nothin' to say
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
We'll both be better off if no one knows
Hush, hush
Got nothin' to say
Just keep it to yourself 'til we get home
Don't touch they're looking your way
If anybody asks, we left alone
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Hush, hush
Don't give it away
Don't give it away 
Don't give it away 
Don't give it awayI told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now
If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites
And let the stone say:
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's deadKeepin' my mouth shut, 'cause I couldn't tell you
Everything I saw when I was still a boy in school
I was still a boy in school
Sometimes I feel like I've gone insane
'Cause I can't change my mind, but I can't stay the same, except you
I still feel the same about you
I can't help but dream about your song
Your voice in my head makes me feel numb
You said
"I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya"
Similar people, won't make a sound
So many people lookin' for somethin' to do
We're all lookin' for somethin' to do
I feel annoying most of the time
But I keep on talkin' just to keep my mind off you
Just to keep my mind off you
I can't help but dream about your song
Your voice in my head makes me feel numb
You said
"I've been home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I've been home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya
I've been home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I've been home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya"
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on ya
I'm at home, I'm waitin', I'm at home, I'm waitin' on yaYou've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far too long
'Cause I never gave up the fight
Until now
It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars
It’s gonna put you through a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even
But giving what you deserve
Oh my, oh my, huh
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da
I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done
You crossed the line too many times
I'm gonna put you in your place
You play with dynamite, don't be surprised
When I blow up in your face
Oh my, oh my, huh
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da
I don't wanna part of your fun
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done with your selfish ways
Done and all the games you play
I'm through with you and everything you say
Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
Mama always taught me that I should play nice
But she didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through with you
You're one bridge I'd like to burn
Scatter the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la dee da
I don't wanna be your "just for fun"
Don't wanna be under your thumb
All I wanna be is done
Done
Hey, hey, ooh
I wanna be done 
So done 
So doneI still remember all the things you said
Laying in my bed
Eye to eye
I'll carry thoughts you put inside my head
'Til the day I'm dead
Why oh why?
Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to
I guess it's not the way things tend to go
Not that I would know
Goodbyes are slow
I saw your picture on the silver screen
Guess you don't miss me
That's the way it seems
Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to
Something good, something real
Something bad, something I can really, really, really feel
Leave me black, leave me blue
Just give me something
I'll take anything from you
Do you ever think of me?
After everything
Give me something to hold on to
I need just a little piece
I'll take anything
Give me something to hold on to
Something to hold on to
Something to hold on to
Something to hold on toI make it too easy
When you pretend that you need me I'm right there
I should be leavin'
But those green eyes I swear
I shouldn't be drinkin'
And I suck at bein' alone with you
There's so many reasons
That I shouldn't want to but I do
I hate the way you make me, just
Wish I could make you hate me
I can't stop though it might break me, still
Can't help the way you make me feel
You call me up crying
Why does that make me want you more?
I know that you're lying
But here I am at your door
You take a piece of me with you and make me feel stupid
You tell me that you want me back and I let you do it
I let you do it
I hate the way you make me, just
Wish I could make you hate me, stop
'Cause I can't though it might break me, still
Can't help the way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
I hate the way you make me, just
Wish I could make you hate me
I can't stop though it might break me
Break me, break me, break me
]
I hate the way you make me, just
Wish I could make you hate me, stop
'Cause I can't though it might break me, still
Can't help the way
I hate the way you make me, just
Wish I could make you hate me, stop
'Cause I can't though it might break me, still
Can't help the way you make me feelKorkma benden
Gidiyorum
Sen uyurken ölüyorum
Yakın değilsin, göremezsin
Masum değilsin, ağlayamazsın
Oyun değil ki, dönemem biliyorum
Pişman değilim, sonunu görüyorum
Paramparça bir taş, yerini arıyorum
Karanlıkta düşerse kaybolur biliyorum
Kaybolsun, dert değil
Kaybolsun, taş benim
Kaybolsun, toprak olsun
Kaybolsun, aşk bittiOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Are we something to each other
Or are we just blowing smoke?
Are we caught between the covers
Or is there something more going on in between us, or not?
Is it just on the surface, or what?
We should be honest
'Cause sometimes I can't tell
Do we really want this
Or are we lying to ourselves?
Is it the burning hearts alone in the dark
That make the midnight call?
Now we're caught between the real thing
And nothing at all
So we should be honest
We should be honest
Do you feel it when you kiss me?
'Cause I know you do somehow
I don't know when we got where we got
But we're both here somehow
And I thought it was nothing until now
We should be honest
'Cause sometimes I can't tell
Do we really want this
Or are we lying to ourselves?
Is it the burning hearts alone in the dark
That make the midnight call?
Now we're caught between the real thing
And nothing at all
So we should be honest
(In between us, or not
Is it just on the surface, or what?)
Is this the real thing?
Is this the real thing?
We should be honest
'Cause sometimes I can't tell
Do we really want this

Is it the burning hearts alone in the dark
That make the midnight call?

Sometimes I can't tell

Are we lying to ourselves?
Is it the burning hearts alone in the dark
That make the midnight call?
Now we're caught between the real thing
And nothing at all
So we should be honestI can't, I can't, I can't stand the man
I'm seeing in the mirror
I try, I try to get my mind right
But it never gets much clearer
Maybe I should see somebody
'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stop
All my friends, they left me for dead
And I don't have a clue where I am
I lost my keys now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
All my friends, they hate me again
I get too drunk when I get depressed
I lost my shit now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
I can't, I can't, I can't pay the rent
'Cause I wasted all my money
I try, I try to laugh off my life
But lately, it's not funny 
Maybe I should see somebody
'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stop
All my friends, they left me for dead
And I don't have a clue where I am
I lost my keys now all I got left
Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette
All my friends, they hate me again

'Cause I can't keep this up
Everything inside my body
Is telling me to stopMy mother she told me
First find a way I can support me
Before I find someone to love and find I cannot afford things, but
You make me feel like an American dreamer
White picket fence, I'll put a rock on your finger
I've never said this before
But I've never been so sure
I think I wanna buy you a house
I think I wanna share forever right now
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
I think I wanna buy you a house
I think I wanna share forever right now
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
And if the bank man comes
I hope you stay
If this house gets messed up
You and me cleaning up
Cause in sickness and in health, I know that
You make me feel like a lottery winner
Move over Pablo, I'm a big time spender
I've never said this before
But I've never been so sure
I think I wanna buy you a house
I think I wanna share forever right now
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
I think I wanna buy you a house
I think I wanna share forever right now
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
And if the bank man comes
I hope you stay
And if the bank man comes
I hope you stay
Come in and be my roommate for life
I got two spaces out in front of the drive
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
I think I wanna buy you a house
I think I wanna share forever right now
And if the bank man comes to steal it away
I hope you, I hope you stay
And if the bank man comes
I hope you stay
And if the bank man comes
I hope you stay
You make me feel like an American dreamerWe carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer no?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all pointed out the way to go and scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand
Now I want you to know that while you were watched, discovered that there was no one true
That I myself really thought
It was just a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
All that false instruction which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse
Oh, but what kind of love is this which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is briefI was romantic
And young and stupid
I met my husband, you know how these things go
You've got your story
You're in your movie
You are the hero
You think you know
You think you know what happens
You think it all will happen
You think it all will go a certain way
You think you know the story
You think a happy ending
But you don't know the story
What about you, General?
You have someone waiting for you in Egypt?
A wife?
Me? No, no. I had at one time, but—
Ahh, but then you see it
You learn your lesson
Grow up a little
You settle in
Then it is what it is
You've got what you got, then blah, blah, blah...Rag Mama rag, I can't believe its true
Rag Mama rag, what did you do?
I crawled up to the railroad track
Let the 4:19 scratch my back
Sag Mama sag, what's come over you
Rag Mama rag, I'm pullin' out your gag
Gonna turn you loose like an old caboose
Got a tail I need to drag
I ask about your turtle
And you ask about the weather
I can't jump a hurdle and
We can't get together
We could be relaxin'
In my sleepin' bag
But all you want to do for me, Mama, is
Rag Mama rag, there's no where to go
Rag Mam rag, come on, rosin up the bow
Rag Mama rag, where do you roam
Rag Mama rag, bring your skinny little body back home
It's dog eat dog and cat eat mouse
You can rag Mama rag all over my house
Hailstones beatin' on the roof
The bourbon is a hundred proof
And you and me and the telephone
Our destiny is quite well known
We don't need to sit and brag
All we gotta do is rag, Mama, rag, Mama, rag
Rag Mama rag, where do you roam
Rag Mama rag, bring your skinny little body back homeThe war was over
And the spirit was broken
The hills were smokin'
As the men withdrew
We stood on the cliffs
Oh and watched the ships
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous
They signed a treaty
And our homes were taken
Loved-ones forsaken
They didn't give a damn
Try to raise a family
End up an enemy
Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham
Acadian driftwood
Gypsy tailwind
They call my home
The land of snow
Canadian cold front
Movin' in
What a way to ride
Oh what a way to go
Then some returned
To the motherland
The high command
Had them cast away
Some stayed on
To finish what they started
They never parted
They're just built that way
We had kin livin'
South of the border
They're a little older
And they been around
They wrote in a letter
Life is a whole lot better
So pull up your stakes, children
And come on down
Fifty under zero when the day became a threat
My clothes were wet
And I was drenched to the bone
Then out ice fishin', mmm
Too much repetition
Make a man want to leave
The only home he's known
Sailed out of the Gulf
Headed for St. Pierre
Nothing to declare
All we had was gone
Broke down along the coast oh
What hurt the most
When the people there said
"You better keep movin' on"
Everlastin' summer
Filled with ill-contempt
This government
Had us walkin' in chains
This isn't my turn
This isn't my season
Can't think of one good reason
To remain oh
We worked in the sugar fields
Up from New Orleans
It was ever-green
Up until the flood
You could call it an omen
Point ya where ya goin'
Set my compass North
I got winter in my blood
Sais tu, Acadie j'ai le mal du pays
Ta neige, Acadie, fait des larmes au soleil
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle ooI'm going down to Rose Marie's
She never does me wrong
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song
It's a wicked life but what the hell
Everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meat
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some fun
Now, whenever I get up
And I can't find what I need
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And get something quick to eat
It's not a bad way to make a living
And I ain't complainin' none
Oh, I can pull my plum, and drink my rum
And then go on home and have my fun
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some fun
Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks
Well, every time you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin' for me to come
Going to Acapulco, going on the run
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun
Yeah, going to have some funYou keep running your mouth, you keep running your mouth
Trying to figure out what you're even talking about
You keep dragging me down, you keep dragging me down
This music's finally loud enough to drown you out
Keep me in heaven
'Cus I know, you were cold
You change your mind, with a change in time
I'm running in a circle and I'm done trying
Don't apologize, can't hear you now
This music's finally loud enough to drown you out
Keep me in heaven
'Cus I know, you were cold
Keep me from saving you
'Cus I know, it's what you want, it's what you want
I watched you go, and I stood still
I never told you no, you're the one, you will
I watch you go, and I stood still
I never told you no, you're the one, you will
Keep me in heaven
'Cus I know, you were cold
Keep me from saving you
'Cus I know
It's what you want,  it's what you want
Keep me in heaven
'Cus I know, you were cold
Keep me from saving you
'Cus I know
It's what you want, it's what you want
It's what you want, it's what you wantA lot's been changin' lately and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's everybody else
But I'm done wastin' my time on the woe is me bull****
That's keepin' me from being myself
So look around and tell me what you want me to see
Maybe you're the person that you always wanted to be
Why you wanna be a sad boy, waste your time?
Lookin' for something that was right here all along
I think we're gettin' it wrong
It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but wе've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smеll the **** roses
I said that I would never get what I want 
But I was only lookin' for a reason to flaunt
Think I'm over tryna break down everything that comes out
Maybe it's impossible to know what it means
What's it like to be a loser, happiness abuser?
Smilin' at the thought of never livin' it down
Does it matter if it's uphill, downhill?
I'm lettin' it go, I'm lettin' it out
It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but we've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the **** roses
It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but we've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the roses
It's too bad
When did it get cool to be so sad?
We're spinnin' backwards, did we all go mad?
Yeah, we're only human but we've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the **** roses
(A lot's been changin' lately and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's everybody else)
We've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the roses
(So look around and tell me what you want me to see
Maybe you're the person that you always wanted to be)
We've got hands and hearts and noses
So stop and smell the rosesHere we are in this moment
Eyes closed
Where we going?
Here I am with my arms wide open
Go 'head, close the curtains
I don't care where we'll end up
Right now, let's be in love
Here I am with my heart wide open
Go 'head, close the curtains
Lately, things been getting so crazy

I just wanna stay in the darkYou know how to keep me waiting
You know there’s a call that you missed
You know that I get impatient
Cause I know you saw that shit
You got me on the back burn baby
You got me staying up all night
You got me in a situation
But you gotta know this isn’t right
Got me out here, got me thinking what I would do
Got me in my head, got me wishing I was with you
Got me wishing I was with you
I’ll be outside I been cooped up
Bloodshot eyes need a ride will you pick up
Couldn’t get it right and you’re sleeping on me now
Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow
Rebound feeling like a re-run
Everything that we’ve done
Funny how it all played out
You’re good at looking at me like I’m see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by now
How do I get your attention
How does it feel to always have mine
How do I address this tension
How you’re looking through me every time
Got me out here, got me thinking what I would do
Got me in my head, got me wishing I was with you
God, I’m wishing I was with you
I’ll be outside I been cooped up
Bloodshot eyes need a ride will you pick up
Couldn’t get it right and you’re sleeping on me now
Woke up standing in the middle of the street somehow

You're good at looking at me like I'm see through
But I gotta see you
I shoulda learned by nowWe can talk about it now
It's that same old riddle, only starts from the middle
I'd fix it but I don't know how
Well, we could try to reason, but you might think it's treason
One voice for all
Echoing  echoing along the hall
Don't give up on father's clock
We can talk about it now
Come, let me show you how
To keep the wheels turnin' you got to keep the engines churnin'
Well, did ya ever milk a cow? 
Well, I had the chance one day but I was all dressed up for Sunday!
Everybody, everywhere:
Do you really care?
Well, then pick up your heads and walk
We can talk about it now
It seems to me we've been holding something
Underneath our tongues
I'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back
It would likely burst your lungs
Whoa, stop me, if I should sound kinda
Down in the mouth
But I'd rather be burned in Canada
Than to freeze here in the South!
Pulling that eternal plough
We got to find a sharper blade, or have a new one made
Rest awhile and cool your brow
Don't ya see, there's no need to slave, the whip is in the grave
No salt, no trance
It's safe now  to take a backward glance
Because the flames have turned to chalk!
We can talk about it now
We can talk about it nowI wanna call out your name
But I'm scared of what you'll say
When I think about myself
Have I changed? Am I someone else?
This isn't what it was, back when I was young
I thought these dreams were friends of mine
But they turn to monsters in my mind
You tried to warn me from the start
But I would not change my stubborn heart
I wanna call out your name
But I'm scared of what you'll say
When I think about myself
Have I changed? Am I someone else?
This isn't what it was, back when I was young
You've been on my mind these days
No matter how, you stay the same
It's funny how things always change
I woke up farther than I came
I wanna call out your name
But I'm scared of what you'll say
When I think about myself
Have I changed? Am I someone else?
This isn't what it was, back when I was young
The more I learn, the less I know
The more I feel, the less I show
The more I learn, the less I know
The more I feel, the less I show
The more I learn, the less I know
The more I feel, the less I show
The more I learn, the less I know
The more I feel, the less I show
I wanna call out your name
But I'm scared of what you'll say
When I think about myself
Have I changed? Am I someone else?
This isn't what it wasA great big house there is somewhere
That's filled with sun and lovely things
Inside the house, there is a room
A baby sleeps, a daddy sings
Thank God, he is a lucky man
A busy man, a happy man
Thank God the gift was given him
To finish all the things he plans
I'm sorry, son, I don't know why
This gift has not been given me
It makes no difference how I try
I end up drifting on the sea
We fell in love, your mom and I
We made our plans and started life
But now we fight and back away
The loser and the loser's wife
I guess I am a patient man
I guess I am a gift to thee
A quiet room, a sleeping child
You need this gift if you're like me
A great big house there is somewhere
That's full of sun and lovely things
Inside the house, there is a room
A baby sleeps, a daddy singsIf your memory serves you well
We were going to meet again and wait
So I’m going to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
But you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well
This wheel’s on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!
If your memory serves you well
I was going to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor’s knot
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was oh so hard to tell
But you knew that we would meet again
If your memory serves you well
This wheel’s on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!
If your memory serves you well
You’ll remember you’re the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done
And after ev’ry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memory served you well
This wheel’s on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!Well I was never one for compromise
I couldn't fit at school
Gonzo by the seventh grade
I played 'em all the fool
Yeah I couldn't find shoes my size
Had to walk ten miles
There's blisters on the backs of my soles
And an illegal smile
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues
Yeah they got me on accessory
Thirty days in jail
One headlight in a Louisville night
Without a chance at bail
But I'll be home by derby time
So please save me a seat
Mint Juleps on the outfield grass
The old south tastes so sweet
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues
Well you can call me Mr. Raoul Duke
I'll know what you mean
Blinded by a quart of rum
And a dose of mescaline
The Mint 400 couldn't slow me down
I kinda like the speed
We're the failure of our generation
For a couple bags of weed
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues
Yeah it's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County bluesI'm not gonna be a joke
I know about your side piece, bro
I’m not gonna fight anymore, yeah
Glad I never had your baby
This'll be a cleaner cut
You can keep the labradors
'Cause you wasted my time
Been two nights, the last night
I’m gonna waste a damn good rhyme on you
Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
Sick I ever touched your body
Sick you ever tasted mine
I should burn the sheets on my bed
I don't want an explanation
I don't wanna still be friends
I just wanna break your neck
'Cause you wasted my time
Been two nights, the last night
I'm gonna waste a damn good line on you
Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
You was living in a dream, dude, in zone
I watched you walking with your keys and your Benzo
Credit card for your bros at the chateau
I got the checks while you checked out on me slow
You didn’t care that all I wanted was a safe zone
Couldn't treat me like a queen or a friend, oh
Couldn’t keep your eyes on me in the end, oh
Cut you off, let you crawl to the next hoe
'Cause you wasted my time
But tonight's the last night
I'm gonna waste a damn good life on you
Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a good life
You had a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You’re never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
So have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it this good twice
Have a, have a, have a good lifeHer sabah bi' gün doğarken
Bi' günde eksilir ömürden
Her şafak bi' hırsız gibi
Elinde bi' fenerle
Cehennem boşuna
Dert çektiğimiz günler
Cennet gün ettiğimiz dünler
Ey zaman bilmez misin
Ettiklerini?
Bir düğüm ki ne sen çözebilirsin, ne ben!
Bilmezsin ne olduğunu
Vazgeç ötelerden yorma kendini
Kendine gel bir düşün
Ben senim, sen ben arama boşuna
Her sabah bi' gün doğarken
Bi' günde eksilir ömürden
Her şafak bi' hırsız gibi
Elinde bi' fenerle
Cehennem boşuna
Dert çektiğimiz günler
Cennet gün ettiğimiz dünler
Ey zaman bilmez misin
Ettiklerini?
Bir düğüm ki ne sen çözebilirsin, ne ben!
Bilmezsin ne olduğunu
Vazgeç ötelerden yorma kendini
Kendine gel bir düşün
Ben senim, sen ben arama boşunaI wish that I smoked cigarettes
Maybe I'd be thinner
I wish that I still went to church
Maybe I'm a sinner
I wish I had a lowride car so I could drive my lowride heart to somewhere where nobody knows your name
I wish that I could call you, but I wish I didn't want to
I wish that I could have you, but I wish I didn't want you
I wish that it got better just like people say
I wish that I could wish you, I wish that I could wish you away
And I'd be okay
I bet I'll forget my own name
Before I'd forget you
But I'll forgive all my enemies
Before I'll forgive you
If I think about it long enough I'll think those memories to dust and finally I could give her what she needs
I wish that I could call you, but I wish I didn't want to
I wish that I could have you, but I wish I didn't want you
I wish that it got better just like people say
I wish that I could wish you, I wish that I could wish you away
And I'd be okay
There'll be better days coming for me
There'll be better days coming for me
But right now I'm slummin', bummin' and slummin' away and that's okay
There'll be better days coming for me
There'll be better days coming for me
But right now I'm slummin', bummin' and slummin' away and that's okay
I wish that I could call you, but I wish I didn't want to
I wish that I could have you, but I wish I didn't want you
I wish that it got better just like people say
I wish that I could wish you, I wish that I could wish you away
And I'd be okay
Wish you away
But that's just wishful thinkingThey say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Now, yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long, I hear him shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be releasedIt's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mindIt ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow
But baby, I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes
And tell me that you're sorry
Well, you might as well throw gasoline
On a fire
The way you lie
You lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
The way you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys
And baby, I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now
And do the whole wide world a service
Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out
Like a piece of wire
Like a piece of wire
The way you lie
You lie like the man with the slick back hair
Who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard
After last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive
To the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long
Bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry-y
Well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring
That you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling
And watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well, it's what you do
It's who you areForefather pointed to kingdom come
Sadly told his only son
Just be careful what you do
It all comes back on you
False witness spread the news
Somebody's gonna lose

I was dreaming of war; you saw that I wouldn't die
Was dreaming of shores that my ship would find
I was dreaming because it made me feel so alive
Was dreaming it all from my bed last night
You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah

Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
I was feeling a storm, but it wasn't outside
Was feeling a force; I'm electrified
I was feeling my heart; there was thunder inside
Was feeling it all from my bed last night
You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever

Cause 8-bit life's so simple
Had a pretty low key upbringing
So how do I explain these demons
I'm a little jet black mood ring
Everybody dies kinda movie
And I know my folks they worry
Cause I'm a little, I'm a little sad faced
I only like sad songs
Something may be wrong with me
And I leave the TV on
So someone's in the room
Find me a girl, let her wear my sweater
Under the hood we could hide out together
And I'll sing her all sad songs
And hope she sings along
And hope she sings
And hope she sings along
Ms Slipknot t-shirt, never heard that band
You think love is a chemical romance
Maybe our silver living is not really finding
Cause I wanna get lost with you
She got my white Vans sneakers
Catching a wave from the speakers
And I know her folks they worry
Cause she's a little, she's a little sad faced
I only like sad songs
Something may be wrong with me
And I leave the TV on
So someone's in the room
Find me a girl, let her wear my sweater
Under the hood we could hide out together
And I'll sing her all sad songs
And hope she sings along
And hope she sings
And hope she sings along
Don't you wanna run away with me now
I can see your smile even when it's upside down
I only like sad songs
Something may be wrong with me
And I leave the TV on
So someone's in the room
Find me a girl, let her wear my sweater
Under the hood we could hide out together
And I'll sing her all sad songs
And hope she sings along
And hope she sings
And hope she sings along
Don't you wanna run away with me now
I can see your smile even when it's upside downThey like to kick you when you're down
They like it better when you're there on the ground
And up 'til now I've never made a sound
Hey, hey
I bet they've never had a broken heart
But they sure know how to beat the hell out of one
Sometimes I think they do it just for the fun
Hey, hey
But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win
Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
I'm gonna finish what I started now
You interrupted me with all your doubts
How dare you forget where I started out
Uh-oh, uh-oh
But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win
Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid, uh-huh
I believe in what I am; I believe in what I was
I believe in losing you, I've never been given so much
I believe it's been a year, the worst one I've ever lived
I believe I'm better now than I have ever been
I believe that ever since everything went south
I believed in every word that ever came out of my mouth
I believe you missed me, but you don't have to miss me, cause
I'm not leaving again
Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute; I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
Cause in the end
Yeah, I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
I'll save you a spot at my big parade
You're all invited on my comeback day
I'll serve you ice cream and lemonade
Hey, heyIs it a hymn?
Is it a love song?
The music is so beautiful
It melts away so quickly
And you're standing in the silence
Standing in the darkness
Singing about wishing
Every day, you stare to the west, to the south
You can see for miles, but it all stays the same
Then honey in your ears, spice in your mouth...Here I am
Here I am
And the light is dying
Where are you?
Where are you?
Will you answer me?
All alone
In the quiet
Ah, my ears are thirsty
For your voice
For your voice
Can you answer me?
If I try, maybe I can see your shadow
In the sodium light that masquerades as moon
If I try, I might take off like a sparrow
And I'll travel along a guiding breeze
Very soon
Very soon
That's the sound of longing
Are you there?
Are you there?
Will you answer me?
In my dreams, my beloved lies beside me
When the sun lights the room, I find it's only me
Only me
 
 
Only me
 
 
With the
World
 
 
Around
Me
 
Only you when the sun is gone
 
 
Only me when the moon is
 
 
With the world
 
All around me
 
With the world around me
Only you
When the sun and moon and stars are gone
What's left is only you
Will you answer me?

And Turtle, that friend of hers, with his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk, and his cheese in the cash
They’re all gonna be there at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Everybody from right now to over there and back
The louder they come, the bigger they crack
Come now, sweet cream, don’t forget to flash
We’re all gonna meet at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn
Then along came Jones, emptied the trash
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I’m hitting it too hard, my stones won’t take
I get up in the morning but it’s too early to wake
First it’s hello, goodbye then push and then crash
But we’re all gonna make it at that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bash
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist
I punched myself in the face with my fist
I took my potatoes down to be mashed
Then I made it on over to that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It’s that million dollar bashWhat is that?
I don't know
Powerglove
That little bastard
With his tricks and vile forms of play
Hacking, shaving, slicing, mutilating
All that gets before him, or that gets in his way
Coming around, down the stairs
The wood cracked beneath my feet
My hand slid across the rail
Collecting dust on my fingertips
Then I came into a dark room
That smelled of wet stone and many years
And there was a robotic retard
With a blank empty stare
It was a little android man
Half the size that I am
Scissors on his head
Scissors on his fucking head
Little android man
Born without a soul
Without that force of reason
The scissors took control
Little android man
Born without a heart
If he's in your vicinity he'll cut you apart
Here he comes, there's no time
It's just a game
Don't look back, he's right behind
Here's your piece of mind
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut-Cut!
Little android man
Born without a soul
Without a voice of reason
The scissors took control
Little android man
Born without a heart
Anything in his vicinity
He'll cut you apart
1, 2, 3, 4
Little android man
Never, never, never trust a
Little android man
He'll cut, cut, cut, cut!Do you think that you know me?
Do you think that I’m alive and doing well?
You must know me better than myself
It’s not hard to listen
And take for granted that you know what you’re talking about
You must know me better than myself
But people wanna know, but I’m not talking
I'm not talking, I'm not talking
Yeah, people wanna know, but I’m not talking
I'm not talking, I'm not talking
People wanna know, but I’m not talking
I'm not talking, I'm not talking

I know that you’re talking, 'cause I got your phone callWe were close
We were close, I would go
Take a bullet to my head
You should know
You should know, you were my bro
Always had your back
At the least, we coulda talked about it
But you found another way to get around it
Had to let you go, let you go
You don't get another chance
When your hero hits the ground
Why'd you have to be human?
And let me think you were perfect, but I don't know now
How could you do it?
Building me up just to bring me back down
Had all these visions in my head
And I thought you were a friend
Why'd you have to be human?
Building me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down
D-down, down, d-down
Down, down, down, d-down
I was young
I was young, I was dumb
Now I'm putting up these walls
Smartened up
Smartened up, now I'm done
Watching all my idols fall
When your hero hits the ground
Why'd you have to be human?
And let me think you were perfect, but I don't know now
How could you do it?
Building me up just to bring me back down
Had all these visions in my head
And I thought you were a friend
Why'd you have to be human?
Building me up just to let me down
Just to let me down, down, down
D-down, down, d-down
Down, down, down, d-down
Why you'd have to be human?
Down, down, down, d-down
Down, down, down, d-down
Why you'd have to be human?
At the least we coulda talked about it

Came floating on the jasmine wind
From the west, from the south
Honey in my ears
Spice in my mouth
Dark and thrilling
Strange and sweet
Cleopatra and the handsome thief
And they floated in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
And they floated in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
Friday evening, Omar Sharif
In black and white and blurry through tears
My mother and I would sit there in a trance
He was cool to the marrow, the pharaoh of romance
Sunday morning
Umm Kulthum
Her voice would fill our living room
The ship from Egypt always came
Sailing in on radio waves
And the jasmine wind, deep perfume
Umm Kulthum
And the living room becomes a garden
And the TV set becomes a fountain
And the music flows in the garden
And everything grows
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
Came floating on a lemon leaf
Flying in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
And we dance with them on a jasmine scented wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar SharifAnd a beef will rise again, broken machine in his hand
Ten words: snapping bunnies twitching gurgling forget the bombs in your eyes
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies
SMASH those fucking bunnies
Send them information in a sensationalist manner
THEY CORRUPT
Heads snapping and misspelling eyes twitching in response to the sound of the words
Red world-like words zooming boiling
Moons in the shallow sky
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies
SMASH those fucking bunnies
Twitching bleeding screaming bring the hammer down
Screaming bunnies bleeding bloody bunnies smeared across the ground
Drool spilling down my chin unto my beard as he screams red words at
A blank and pointless sky of mothers. Red words popping and crackling black
Ten words: Snapping bunnies twitching gurgling forget the bombs
IN YOUR EYES
Forget the bombs in your eyes
Speak the words to crack open the skyLife is a hustle for young and for old
But never take for granted the place you called home
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
So never go easy, never go easy
Ain't seen most friends in a few years
I doubt they know that I'm not there
My dad says, "Son, look how you changed"
Thanks for the talk, Dad, but I can't stay
Am I wrong for wanting something else?
I'm the one that's gotta see myself
In the mirror and feel alright
So tell me what's bad with a good, good life
The city don't sleep
The city don't sleep
The city don't sleep
So neither do I, neither do I, do I
Life is a hustle for young and for old
But never take for granted the place you called home
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
So never go easy, never go easy
Yeah
Long headache nights and heartbreak days
How many sharp knives can my back take?
Would I even see warning signs?
Am I finding myself or losing my mind?
What if I get there, everything I'm chasing?
Still want more—hell, was that time wasted?
Would I tell truths if they don't rhyme?
So much bad with a good, good time
The city don't sleep
The city don't sleep
The city don't sleep
So neither do I, neither do I, do I
Life is a hustle for young and for old
But never take for granted the place you called home
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
So never go easy, never go easy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So never, never go easy
Life is a hustle for young and for old
But never take for granted the place you called home
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
So never go easy, never go easy
Life is a hustle for young and for old
But never take for granted the place you called home
Anything worth having is worth fighting for
So never go easy, never go easy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So never, never go easy
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So never, never go easyWe carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us all away
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun could treat a father so?
To wait upon him hand and foot and always tell him "No"
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
It was all so very painless
When you ran out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
We pointed you the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
I want you to know that while we watched
You discovered no one would be true
That I myself was among
The ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is briefCome down to the manger
See the little stranger
Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the prince of peace
The wheels start turning
Torches start burning
And the old wise men journey from the East
How a little baby boy
Bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter
Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
A shepherd on a hillside
Where over my flock I bide
Oh a cold winter night a band of angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice
Say, "Fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the newborn king"
How a little baby boy
Bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter
Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
I saw it with my own eyes
Written up in the sky
But why a simple herdsmen such as I?
And then it came to pass
He was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high
How a little baby boy
Bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter
Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Son of a carpenter
Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonight
Be tonightTake what is left of this
Before I lose myself in this
You say this every time
Quit acting like we're fine
I hate the way you always took it too far
You cried all the way to the car
And it seems like you don't know
You don't know me
Well I guess it's really my fault
I did it for myself this time
I guess I started over
Without you in mind
I guess it's really over
I'm taking me to places I've never been
I'm putting rubber to the asphalt
And I'm never coming home again
I've heard all of your lines
But we've fought like this since Valentine's
And you can't make me this time
I've got my future self in mind
It's eight fifteen and I don't know where to start
Can't you see how unhappy you are?
And it seems like you don't know
You don't know me
Well I guess it's really my fault
I did it for myself this time
I guess I started over
Without you in mind
And I guess it's really over
I'm taking me to places I've never been
I'm putting rubber to the asphalt
And I'm never coming home
Yeah
I guess it's really my fault
I did it for myself this time 
I guess I started over
Without you in mind
It's really over
I'm taking me to places I've never been
I'm putting rubber to the asphalt
And I'm never coming home
All the things I always thought that I knew
Never felt like myself around you
But I know you don't know, you don't know me
You don't know, you don't know me
You don't know, you don't know me
You don't know, you don't know meWell You See Love, Makes You Do Crazy Things

Alisema anaenda PE

You melt the ice
You melt yourself
And soon you're all one puddle
You talk, she talks
It's not about the conversation
The words are like your lips, are reaching out
To kiss the ear
You're here, she's here
Two drops of water
The pull, the pull
Invisible, but really real
Your eyes, her eyes
And soon, you're looking in a mirror
You realize you can't get nearer
You are both right there
You glow, she glows
Two suns, no shadow
Your skin, her skin
And everything's alight
No edge, no edge
No walls, no border
Two streams of water
That become the sea
The dance
 
The dance
 
 
The dance
 
The dance
You see the wind that moves the trees is
The algebra that moves your knees
Is written in her eyes
Her eyes
 
Your eyes
 
 
Her eyes
 
Your eyes
You're only looking in a mirror
You realize you can't get nearer
And there's nowhere you don't meetI feel like I've been here before
I chose the wrong path
I opened the wrong door
But I've been trying
I been trying
To make my way on back to this
First time I saw your face
The taste when we kissed
Lets start over, I'll do better
Maybe next time, we'll be together
All I'm asking
Let me change your mind
All I'm asking for is you
My mind is right for the first time
I found a reason, I figured out the round
If you let me, I'll do better
Maybe next time, we'll be together
All I'm asking
Let me change your mind
All I'm asking for is you

There's a young girl next to me
Talking 'bout her therapy
Must be nice to have a way to cope
Our family wonders why we're so distant
'Cause our priorities are so different
We just wanna feel something
That "come-up" type of "real" something
Yeah, we just wanna feel something tonight
Brushing off the cynical
I'm deaf to all the critical
Voices screaming that our hands are tied
Their faces sour, call it lemonade
'Cause me and my friends play a different game
We just wanna feel something
That "come-up" type of "real" something
Yeah, we just wanna feel something tonight
Doctor gave me codeine, but I prescribe my dosing
Faking a cough, pop the lid off till I don't even know me
That kid got potential, but he's not affluential
Reality-checks and credit card debts
Tell me how to grow up
I sit and wonder why we're so different
Make no apology for this distance
We just wanna feel something
That "come-up" type of "real" something
Yeah, we just wanna feel something tonight
Brushing off the cynical

Sound like someone singin' harmony
And me and my brother we don't make a peep
We go down slow to the hangin' tree
Hangin' tree's down by the river's edge
We come up stream and peek over the ledge
And mamma's got a rope and a kitchen knife
And the harmony singer is the preacher's wife
Mamma put a bible in her right hand
And asked her if she been seein' her man
Well, me and my brother don't hear no more
Cause right then the rain began to pour
It was an hour past dark when she came back home
And we never saw papa round here no more
Mamma took to sittin' by the hangin' tree
But there ain't no body singin' harmony
The preacher's wife she don't leave his side
And we ain't got papa to tan no hide
My older brother he took his life
And I took to peepin' on the preacher's wife
I left my mamma when I was sixteen
Strung up in the limbs of the hangin' treeDark thoughts
Warm night, air is heavy
Traffic is slow and steady
Hands shake, I don't know why 
My skin starts to panic
You speak only static
Secrets behind my eyes 
Sorry if I couldn't hear a single word you said
I got an army full of voices waging wars inside my head
I've been having dark thoughts 
They've been cloudin' up my mind
Like someone's turnin' out the light on me, on me, yeah
I've been having dark thoughts 
Do you ever feel like me?
'Cause I could use the company, the company
In my dark thoughts 
Dark thoughts 
Sometimes you're a candle
Don't know how you handle
My highs
And all my lows

In my dark thoughts 
Dark thoughts 
In my dark thoughts 
Dark thoughts Pushing thrusting bulbs into the light
A peasant thought starts its flight
From reason and from fact
A peasant thought
Grows two legs
Opens up its heart
An absurd courtship
Oh dear
Oh dear
What has become of hesitation?
Oh dear
Oh dear
Did the mosquito's bite bring me down?
She said, "Let's sing the crippling song"
Her lips always ate moments like days
...and I was not prepared
I was gone
...and I was not prepared
To let my guard down
So I fed her the end
The end of my spear
We would throw rocks n' things into our well ourselves as well
We would ride to a
...clack and kabik
Like dinosaurs
Dropping into the darkness we sink
You should have seen her...
At one with the gods
She said, "Let's sing the cripple song"
Then I was gone
Oh dear, oh dear!
Then I was gone
Oh dear, oh dear!
Then I was gone
She said, "Let's sing the cripple song together"
Then I was goneMama got a voice like sugar it's so sweet and fine
Sister singing Amazing Grace, she right in time
And they're laying poor papa low in the ground that he worked and sowed
Now they waitin' at the Jackson Station for the train to roll
She been up all night, she got crows walking 'round her eyes
But she can still raise a cup in a toast to a well run dry
He left her on a Tuesday still, with gin, whiskey and a bottle of pills
And now she's waitin' at the Jackson Station looking over the hill
Take me away, hear that whistle play a sad, sad song
Lay me down where the river runs wide and strong
Sometimes she rides a ticket home, other times she'll leave you all alone
Just a-waitin' at the Jackson Station for the train to go
Well the 4:19 rolls on the Red Ball Line
And the backwater shack's been waking to the 419
Said she got the smoke coming out of the stack, dead running on a 10-mile track
Just waitin' at the Jackson Station never coming back
She waitin' at the Jackson Station never coming back
She waitin' at the Jackson Station never coming back
Say  ain't never coming backJamie was a girl next door

Growing up here on Francis St
I think the kids are gonna be alright
I know we've had to come back once or twice
Why are you looking at me so surprised
I think the kids are gonna
I think the kids are gonna
I think that we'll be alright
I think that we'll be alright
I think the kids are gonna
I think the kids are gonna
I think that we'll be alrightShe's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of the house
A blind believer in all I dare to be
There's no safer place I've found
Than the shoulder of her white night gown
Oh, I've got the best and the worst of her in me
And I'd share her if I could
So the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And our cares would all be freer
If the world had a mother like mine
She's our father's one great love
She's the one he wanted most
She's the light in the window of the house I grew up in
She takes the midnight call
And she's the bravest of us all
And she sings in the garden that she let's her hair down in
Oh, the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
Tonight would be easier
And our dreams would all be deeper
If the world had a mother like mine
Don't go away
Don't go away from me
Oh, I understand
She is a helping hand
Still, I have to say
She's the sky that holds the clouds
She's the lady of our house
We all need her
But no one more than me
Oh, the wars would all be over
'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
We'd walk on grass that's greener
And the dishes would all be cleaner
If the world had a mother like mine
Ooh, like mineWe want to turn everything around
She's a real writer and say goodnight-er
She's a sadist of a believer
I'm not a bridge, I'm not the bay
I'm not a car, taxi or train
I'm not a power tool or a construction crew
I'm not the weapon simple or mass device
Just a man with two hands
What should I do when you walk out?
I dress in white
Become Cloudwalker
I want to scan the crowd
And point to where the rain flows
I'm a white cloud
I'm a white cloud
We've got clouds in our heads
Dreams in our skies
We never say goodbye
What should I do when you walk out?
We have soft clouds in our heads
We have dreams in our skies
We never say goodbye
I AM THE SKY
DON'T ASK WHY
I FEEL IT AS I FEEL MY BREATH DEEP INSIDE
I'M A RIDE HIGHER
A TRIED TRIER
A NEVER GIVE UP VICTORY FIGHT IGNITER
Row after row after row
Row after row after row
Sentinel trees go
SHE'S A DREAM BOOMER
A NEVER TOO SOONER
A 3D TREE RIGHT BEFORE ME FALLING IN THE SEWER
SHE'S A ROCK-SLIDE
A ROCKET IN THE SKY
A PLANE CRASHING TO THE EARTH AND EVERYONE WHO DIED
I'M A COUNTDOWN TICK
MOVING QUITE QUICK
TWO LOVERS CONFESSING A TRYST
SHE'S A THUNDERSTORM
SINCE THE DAY SHE WAS BORN
AND SHE BEAT-BEAT-BEATS LIKE THE HEART OF A WAR
Row after row after row
Row after row after row
Sentinel trees go
I'm looking down on trees
Let's not let this moment... be the sameIf you find me in a gloom, or catch me in a dream
Inside my lonely room, there is no in between
Whispering pines, rising of the tide
If only one star shines
That's just enough to get inside
I will wait until it all goes 'round
With you in sight, the lost are found
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea
Protect my only light, cause she once belonged to me
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry
For if I live again, these hopes will never die
I can feel you standing there
But I don't see you anywhere
Standing by the well, wishing for the rains
Reaching to the clouds, for nothing else remains
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done
Try looking through a haze
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun
I will wait until it all goes 'round
With you in sight, the lost are foundAcross the land, I'm spoken of*
Wise as a snake, tame as a dove
Just like a wolf, in the sheep’s clothes
Shake the dust off, before I go
I'm your medicine man
I'm your medicine man
I walk the land never seen before
I'm on a mission, conquistador
I'll be your slave, I'll be your king
I'll be what you want, be your everything
I'm your medicine man
I'm your medicine man
Got juju beads and a mojo drum
Gotta a whole lot more, where that come from
I'll make a sign, I'll cross your head
Make you shake and dance, Gonna raise the dead
I'm your medicine man
I'm your medicine man
I'll take your pulse, I'll fix your health
Give what you need, to save yourself
Might lose your house, might lose your home
But I'll give you back more than you have known
Put you in the black, gonna shake your bones
Your healer, your dealer, your only one
I'm your medicine man
I'm your medicine manI know she's a tracker, any scarlet would back her
They say she's a chooser, but I just can't refuse her
She was just there, but then she can't be here no more
And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives
She's been down in the dunes and she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from the bitter cup, I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, I fear she can't be here no more
And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives
It's long, long when she's gone, I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast, I don't think I'm gonna last
Very much longer
"She's stoned" said the Swede, and the moon calf agreed
I'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock
She was just there somewhere and here I am again
And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receivesNow deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same
See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again
I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, "You can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes"
Now if he says that he's afraid
Take him at his word
And for the price that the poor boy has paid
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh
Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
Fancy people go driftin' by
The moment of truth is right at hand
Just one more nightmare you can stand
Hmm hmm
You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm
Let him start all over againYeh darya aur nadi bhi milte hain kahin
Par rooh jo meri maanay aqal kehti hai nahi
Khamoshiyon mein bhi aksar hain baatein chupi
Par yeh toh woh hi jaanay
Jo kuch bhi kehta nahi
Soch soch ke thak gaya hun main khonay do mujhe
Soch soch ke thak gaya hun main sonay do mujhe
Yeh darya aur nadi bhi milte hain kahin
Par rooh jo meri maanay aqal kehti hai nahi
Yeh abar aur ghata baras jaye gi kahin
Jab hogi roshni toh hogi Jannat wahin
Soch soch ke thak gaya hun main khonay do mujhe
Soch soch ke thak gaya hun main sonay do mujhe
Khonay do
Khonay do

Khonay do mujhe
Khonay do mujhe
Sonay do
Soch soch ke thak gaya hun main sonay do mujhe"Dilation of chronal aperture in 3,2,1"

Initiate instruments set to yesterday!
At the speed light across empty plains of time
On a ship of jewels and gold
All of time unfolds
A seven click blip
For a fifteen eon trip
Crafting deja vu
Event horizon boom
Days rescind and lapse
Birth after death
Tomorrow is the past
Event horizon boom
Cities shrink and fade into the ice age
Dinosaurs now new
Event horizon boom
Time is broken!
How small are we compared to space and time? 
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
All these machines that dream
Make me want to scream
There's no bears or wild things
The future's not what it seems
Causality denied
All of time is now mine
The crisis we both share
Is you are me when I was there
Time after time
It's almost time
Time to say goodbye
At the end of timeSt John’s Eve, gone to see, Marie on Pontchartrain*
Twelve thousand black and white standing in the rain
Gold stars on my forehead, don’t need no tarot deck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Playing spoons on a box down on St Anne’s street
Hoodoo peppers freed a man, charmed the judge’s seat
Silver dollar burn a hole, cashed my last paycheck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Bonfire on midsummer’s eve, ashes on my face
You might fall in love tonight or you might fall from grace
Creole on the bayou paying their respects
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Money on her resting place, X’s on the wall
Rainbow snake has shed its skin, mark the sparrow’s fall
Free from all my burdens, paid up all my debts
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neck
Gris gris satchel in my hand, Cross around my neckTen years ago, on a cool dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but meOh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You could almost think that you're seeing double
On the cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I got me a date with a pretty little girl from Greece
She promised she'd be there with me
When I paint my masterpiece
Oh, the hours we spent, inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions, and a-wasting time
Oh those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes it sure has been a long, hard drive
Train wheels a-running thru the back of my memory
When I ran on a hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday everything is gonna sound like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh to be back in the land of, Coca-cola
Well I left Rome, and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergy men in uniform, and young girls pulling mussels
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspaper men eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, its gonna be different
When I paint my masterpieceNow, I stand in awe and I shake my face
You break your promise all over the place
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Just you comin’ in spilling juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
Now, you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
You’re always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again
Now, I’ve had enough, my box is clean
You know what I’m saying and you know what I mean
From now on you’d best get on someone else
While you’re doing it, keep that juice to yourself
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found againShe's over it, she cannot take no more, yeah
Don't want to quit, but that's a pretty nice door there
I got a bed, it really cost a fortune
I go away and it's too big without you
We got it good, you know how good we got it
We got it bad, you know how bad we got it
I wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is, yeah
He works on automatic
Mr. Clean, but I doubt it
He's got to have his say
Who needs him anyway?
Don't get your kind of music
He lets the others choose it
He thinks you kids are freaks
He wants you off the streets
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is
You don't know what it does to me
You don't know what it means to me
Take it as far as it goes
And I don't want no one to know
It's too late to talk about it
And I ain't changing any of it
Don't listen to us
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it isBaby don't you do it, don't do it
Don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
I sacrificed to make you happy, kept nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me for the love of someone else
My pride is all gone whether I'm right or wrong
I need you baby for to keep on keepin' on
You know I'm trying to do my best
Oh I'm trying to do my best
Don't do it, don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
My biggest mistake was loving you too much and letting you know
Now you got me where you want me and you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass well then you'd surely see
How much heartache and misery, girl, you've been causing me
While I've been trying to do my best
Well I've tried to do my best
Don't do it, don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
Go down to the river and there I be
I'm gonna jump in girl, but you don't care bout me
Open up your eyes
Can't ya see I love ya?
Open up you heart, girl
Can't ya see I need ya?
Oh baby don't do it, do it, do it
Don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it don't you break my heart
My biggest mistake was loving you too much and letting you know
Now you got me where you want me and you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass well then you'd surely see
How much heartache and misery, girl, you've been causing me
While I've been trying to do my best
You know I've tried to do my best
Don't do it, don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heartWe scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time
And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you
But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw
I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote "Forever" with a pocketknife
But forever's going down... tonight
'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's gotta go, it's such a shame doll
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sitting on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holding a chainsaw
Chain, chain, chainsaw
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da 
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, daI like my cornbread in the morning rising
I like my cornbread when it's nice and fresh
I like my cornbread with a little bit of butter
Like them sticky fingers when it gets so wet
Hey mama don't you make a poor man beg
Hey mama don't you hear what I say
I need your cornbread every day, mmm every day
I like to eat my cornbread in the kitchen
I like to eat it on the back porch swing
I like my cornbread in the middle of the winter
I like a little extra cornbread in the spring
In the mornings when I've got a hundred miles to go
I eat my baby's cornbread real slow
And when it's cold and I’m out on the road
My baby's cornbread make me want to come home
I keep my baby's recipe a secret
Ain't had no cornbread like this before
Well sometimes that cornbread gets sticky
But sticky's good in my book I think I'll have some more
Hey mama don't you make a poor man beg, mama don't you make a man beg
Hey mama don't you hear what I say
I need your cornbread every day, mmm every day
Mmm-mmm-mmm, that's right
I like to watch my baby making cornbread
I like to watch her fingers in the dough
Sometimes that cornbread cooks quickly
Sometimes it cooks awful slow
Hey mama don't you make a poor man beg, mama don't, don't you make a man beg
Hey mama don't you hear what I say
I need your cornbread, I need your cornbread, I need your cornbread every day, mmm-mm
Mmm-mmm mama don't you make
Say mama don't you make a poor man beg
Mama don't you make a poor man beg
I need your cornbread every day 
Who-oo-oo, say I need
Mama don't 
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread 
Whoo, I need every day
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread every day
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread every day
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread every day
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread
I need your cornbread every dayNow, there’s a certain thing
That I learned from Jim
That he’d always make sure I’d understand
And that is that there’s a certain way
We all must swim
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
But I ain’t gonna hear it said no more
Now, there’s a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
That fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always
Flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
And I ain’t gonna hear it said no more
“Take care of all of your memories”
Said Nick
“For you cannot relive them
And remember when you’re out there
Trying to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them”
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I’ve heard it said before
And I ain’t gonna hear it said no moreI remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah
Will I ever be satisfied 'cause all I ever seem to find is a...
A postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did
The cruelest thing you ever did
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
I am ruined
Yeah, I'm ruined
Now I am ruined, yeah, I'm ruinedYou can walk on the water, drown in the sand
You can fly off a mountaintop if anybody can
Run away, run away, it's the restless age
Look away, look away, you can turn the page
Hey, buddy, would you like to buy a watch real cheap?
Here on the street
I got six on each arm and two more round my feet
Life is a carnival, believe it or not
Life is a carnival, two bits a shot
Saw a man with the jinx in the third degree
From trying to deal with people, people you can't see
Take away, take away, this house of mirrors
Give away, give away, all the souvenirs
We're all in the same boat ready to float off the edge of the world
The flat old world
The street is a sideshow from the peddler to the corner girl
Life is a carnival, it's in the book
Life is a carnival, take another look
Hey, buddy, would you like to buy a watch real cheap?
Here on the street
I got six on each arm and two more round my feet
Life is a carnival, believe it or not
Life is a carnival, two bits a shot
Life is a carnival
Life is a carnival
Life is a carnivalOut of touch and out of rhyme
The girl you'll never find
She's so damn honest
She won't stick around for sure
The guy that she'll ignore
She's too damn honest
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Hide my heart, how I feel
And pretend this is real for a while
Seasons change but people don't
Oh, and I know you won't
But at least you're honest
But at least you're honest
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Hide my heart, how I feel
And pretend this is real for a while
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Make it harder to breathe for a while
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Make it harder to breathe for a while
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Hide my heart, how I feel
And pretend this is real for a while
It's okay, It's alright
I don't mind wasting time
I'll be fine
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Make it harder to breathe for a while
