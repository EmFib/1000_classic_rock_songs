here comes the story of the hurricane  the man the authorities came to blame  for something that he never done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world  three bodies lyin there  does patty see  and another man named bello  moving around mysteriously  i didnt do it he says  and he throws up his hands  i was only robbin the register  i hope you understand  i saw them leaving he says and he stops  one of us had better call up the cops  and so patty calls the cops  and they arrive on the scene  with their red lights flashin  in the hot new jersey night  meanwhile far away in another part of town  rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around  number one contender for the middleweight crown  had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down  when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road  just like the time before and the time before that  in paterson thats just the way things go  if youre black  you might as well not show up on the street  unless you want to draw the heat  alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops  him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around  he said i saw two men running out  they looked like middleweights  they jumped into a white car with outofstate plates  and miss patty valentine just nodded her head  cop said wait a minute boys this ones not dead  so they took him to the infirmary  and though this man could hardly see  they told him that he could identify the guilty men  four in the morning and they haul rubin in  they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs  the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye  says why did you bring him in here for  he aint the guy  heres the story of the hurricane  the man the authorities came to blame  for something that he never done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world  four months later the ghettos are in flame  rubins in south america fighting for his name  while arthur dexter bradleys still in the robbery game  and the cops are putting the screws to him  lookin for somebody to blame  remember that murder that happened in a bar  remember you said you saw the getaway car  you think youd like to play ball with the law  think it mighta been that fighter that you saw  running that night  dont forget that you are white  arthur dexter bradley said im really not sure  the cops said a poor boy like you could use a break  we got you for the motel job  and were talking to your friend bello  now you dont want to have to go back to jail  be a nice fellow  youll be doing society a favor  that sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver  we want to put his ass in stir  we want to pin this triple murder  on him  he aint no gentleman jim  rubin could take a man out with just one punch  but he never did like to talk about it all that much  its my work hed say and i do it for pay  and when its over id just as soon go on my way  up to some paradise  where the trout streams flow and the air is nice  and ride a horse along a trail  but then they took him to the jailhouse  where they try to turn a man  into a mouse  all of rubins cards were marked in advance  the trial was a pigcircus  he never had a chance  the judge made rubins witnesses  drunkards from the slums  to the white folks who watched  he was a revolutionary bum  and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger  no one doubted that he pulled the trigger  and though they could not produce the gun  the da said he was the one  who did the deed  and the allwhite jury agreed  rubin carter was falsely tried  the crime was murder one  guess who testified  bello and bradley and they both baldly lied  and the newspapers they all went along for the ride  how can the life of such a man  be in the palm of some fools hand  to see him obviously framed  couldnt help but make me feel ashamed  to live in a land  where justice is a game  now all the criminals in their coats and their ties  are free to drink martinis  and watch the sun rise  while rubin sits like buddha  in a tenfoot cell  an innocent man in a living hell  yes thats the story of the hurricane  but it wont be over till they clear his name  and give him back the time hes done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world well it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  ifn you dont know by

stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways  ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  oh what did you see my blueeyed son  and what did you see my darling young one  i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  i saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping  i saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding  i saw a white ladder all covered with water  i saw tenthousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  and what did you hear my blueeyed son  and what did you hear my darling young one  i heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning  i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing  i heard tenthousand whispering and nobody listening  i heard one person starve i heard many people laughing  i heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  i heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  oh what did you meet my blueeyed son  and who did you meet my darling young one  i met a young child beside a dead pony  i met a white man who walked a black dog  i met a young woman her body was burning  i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow  i met one man who was wounded in love  i met another man who was wounded in hatred  and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  and what will you do now my blueeyed son  and what will you do now my darling young one  im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling  ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest  where the people are many and their hands are all empty  where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  and the executioners face is always well hidden  where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten  where black is the color where none is the number  and ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it  and reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it  then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinking  but ill know my song well before i start singing  and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall come you masters of war  you that build the big guns  you that build the death planes  you that build all the bombs  you that hide behind walls  you that hide behind desks  i just want you to know  i can see through your masks  you that never done nothing  but build to destroy  you play with my world  like its your little toy  you put a gun in my hand  and you hide from my eyes  and you turn and run farther  when the fast bullets fly  like judas of old  you lie and deceive  a world war can be won  you want me to believe  but i see through your eyes  and i see through your brain  like i see through the water  that runs down my drain  you fasten all the triggers  for the others to fire  then you set back and watch  while the death count gets higher  you hide in your mansion  while the young peoples blood  flows out of their bodies  and is buried in the mud  youve thrown the worst fear  that can ever be hurled  fear to bring children  into the world  for threatening my baby  unborn and unnamed  you aint worth the blood  that runs in your veins  how much do i know  to talk out of turn  you might say that im young  you might say im unlearned  but theres one thing i know  though im younger than you  that even jesus would never  forgive what you do  let me ask you one question  is your money that good  will it buy you forgiveness  do you think that it could  i think you will find  when your death takes its toll  all the money you made  will never buy back your soul  and i hope that you die  and your death will come soon  i will follow your casket  by the pale afternoon  and ill watch while youre lowered  down to your deathbed  and ill stand over your grave  til im sure that youre dead ooh ooh  ooh ooh  mama

youd better leave  and the only sound thats left  after the ambulances go  is cinderella sweeping up  on desolation row  now the moon is almost hidden  the stars are beginning to hide  the fortunetelling lady  has even taken all her things inside  all except for cain and abel  and the hunchback of notre dame  everybody is making love  or else expecting rain  and the good samaritan hes dressing  hes getting ready for the show  hes going to the carnival tonight  on desolation row  ophelia shes neath the window  for her i feel so afraid  on her twentysecond birthday  she already is an old maid  to her death is quite romantic  she wears an iron vest  her professions her religion  her sin is her lifelessness  and though her eyes are fixed upon  noahs great rainbow  she spends her time peeking  into desolation row  einstein disguised as robin hood  with his memories in a trunk  passed this way an hour ago  with his friend a jealous monk  now he looked so immaculately frightful  as he bummed a cigarette  then he went off sniffing drainpipes  and reciting the alphabet  you would not think to look at him  but he was famous long ago  for playing the electric violin  on desolation row  dr filth he keeps his world  inside of a leather cup  but all his sexless patients  theyre trying to blow it up  now his nurse some local loser  shes in charge of the cyanide hole  and she also keeps the cards that read  have mercy on his soul  they all play on the pennywhistle  you can hear them blow  if you lean your head out far enough  from desolation row  across the street theyve nailed the curtains  theyre getting ready for the feast  the phantom of the opera  in a perfect image of a priest  they are spoon feeding casanova  to get him to feel more assured  then theyll kill him with selfconfidence  after poisoning him with words  and the phantoms shouting to skinny girls  get outta here if you dont know  casanova is just being punished for going  to desolation row  at midnight all the agents  and the superhuman crew  come out and round up everyone  that knows more than they do  then they bring them to the factory  where the heart attack machine  is strapped across their shoulders  and then the kerosene  is brought down from the castles  by insurance men who go  check to see that nobody is escaping  to desolation row  praise be to neros neptune  the titanic sails at dawn  everybodys shouting  which side are you on  and ezra pound and t s eliot  fighting in the captains tower  while calypso singers laugh at them  and fishermen hold flowers  between the windows of the sea  where lovely mermaids flow  and nobody has to think too much  about desolation row  yes i received your letter yesterday  about the time the doorknob broke  when you asked me how i was doing  was that some kinda joke  all these people that you mention  yes i know them theyre quite lame  i had to rearrange their faces  and give them all another name  right now i cant read too good  dont send me no more letters no  not unless you mail them  from desolation row early one morning the sun was shining  i was laying in bed  wondering if shed changed at all  if her hair was still red  her folks they said our lives together  sure was going to be rough  they never did like mamas homemade dress  papas bankbook wasnt big enough  and i was standing on the side of the road  rain falling on my shoes  heading out for the east coast  lord knows ive paid some dues  getting through  tangled up in blue  she was married when we first met  soon to be divorced  i helped her out of a jam i guess  but i used a little too much force  we drove that car as far as we could  abandoned it out west  split up on a dark sad night  both agreeing it was best  she turned around to look at me  as i was walking away  i heard her say over my shoulder  well meet again someday  on the avenue  tangled up in blue  i had a job in the great north woods  working as a cook for a spell  but i never did like it all that much  and one day the ax just fell  so i drifted down to new orleans  where i lucky was to be employed  working for a while on a fishing boat  right outside of delacroix  but all the while i was alone  the past was close behind  i seen a lot of women  but she never escaped my mind  and i just grew  tangled up in blue  she was working in a topless place  and i stopped in for a beer  i just kept looking at the side of her face  in the spotlight so clear  and later on when the crowd thinned out  i was just about to do the same  she was standing there in back of my chair  said to me tell me dont i know your name  i muttered something underneath my breath  she studied the lines on my face  i must admit i felt a little uneasy  when she bent down to tie the laces  of my shoe  tangled up in blue  she lit a burner on the stove  and offered me a pipe  i thought youd never say hello she said  you look like the silent type  then she opened up a book of poems  and handed it to me  written by an italian poet  from the thirteenth century  and every one of them words rang true  and glowed like burning coal  pouring off of every page  like it was written in my soul  from me to you  tangled up in blue  i lived with them on montague street  in a basement down the stairs  there was music in the cafes at night  and revolution in the air  then he started into dealing with slaves  and something inside of him died  she had to sell everything she owned  and froze up inside  and when it finally the bottom fell out  i became withdrawn  the only thing i knew how to do  was to keep on keeping on  like a bird that flew  tangled up in blue  so now im going back again  i got to get to her somehow  all the people we used to know  theyre an illusion to me now  some are mathematicians  some are carpenters wives  dont know how it all got started  i dont know what theyre doing with their lives  but me im still on the road  aheading for another joint  we always did feel the same  we just saw it from a different point  of view  tangled up in blue if youre travelin in the north country fair  where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  remember me to one who lives there  for she once was a true love of mine  if you go when the snowflakes storm  when the rivers freeze and summer ends  please see if she has a coat so warm  to keep her from the howling winds  please see if her hair hangs long  if it rolls and flows all down her breast  please see for me if her hairs hangin long  for thats the way i remember her best  im awondering if she remembers me at all  many times ive often prayed  in the darkness of my night  in the brightness of my day  so if youre travelin the north country fair  where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  remember me to one who lives there  for she once was a true love of mine the pale moon rose in its glory  out oer the western town  she told a sad sad story  of the great ship that went down  twas the fourteenth day of april  over the waves she rode  sailing into tomorrow  to a gilded age foretold  the night was black with starlight  the seas were sharp and clear  moving through the shadows  the promised hour was near  lights were holding steady  gliding over the foam  all the lords and ladies  heading for their eternal home  the chandeliers were swaying  from the balustrades above  the orchestra was playing  songs of faded love  the watchman he lay dreaming  as the ballroom dancers twirled  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  into the underworld  leo took his sketchbook  he was often so inclined  he closed his eyes and painted  the scenery in his mind  cupid struck his bosom  and broke it with a snap  the closest woman to him  he fell into her lap  he heard a loud commotion  something sounded wrong  his inner spirit was saying  that he couldnt stand here long  he staggered to the quarterdeck  no time now to sleep  water on the quarterdeck  already three foot deep  smokestack was leaning sideways  heavy feet began to pound  he walked into the whirlwind  sky splitting all around  the ship was going under  the universe had opened wide  the roll was called up yonder  the angels turned aside  lights down in the hallway  flickering dim and dull  dead bodies already floating  in the double bottom hull  the engines then exploded  propellers they failed to start  the boilers overloaded  the ships bow split apart  passengers were flying  backward forward far and fast  they mumbled fumbled and tumbled  each one more weary than the last  the veil was torn asunder  tween the hours of twelve and one  no change no sudden wonder  could undo what had been done  the watchman lay there dreaming  at fortyfive degrees  he dreamed that the titanic was sinking  dropping to her knees  wellington he was sleeping  his bed began to slide  his valiant heart was beating  he pushed the tables aside  glass of shattered crystal  lay scattered roundabout  he strapped on both his pistols  how long could he hold out  his men and his companions  were nowhere to be seen  in silence there he waited for  time and space to intervene  the passageway was narrow  there was blackness in the air  he saw every kind of sorrow  heard voices everywhere  alarmbells were ringing  to hold back the swelling tide  friends and lovers clinging  to each other side by side  mothers and their daughters  descending down the stairs  jumped into the icy waters  love and pity sent their prayers  the rich man mister astor  kissed his darling wife  he had no way of knowing  be the last trip of his life  calvin blake and wilson  gambled in the dark  not one of them would ever live to  tell the tale or disembark  brother rose up gainst brother  in every circumstance  they fought and slaughtered each other  in a deadly dance  they lowered down the lifeboats  from the sinking wreck  there were traitors there were turncoats  broken backs and broken necks  the bishop left his cabin  to help all those in need  turned his eyes up to the heavens  said the poor are yours to feed  davey the brothelkeeper  came out dismissed his girls  saw the water getting deeper  saw the changing of his world  jim backus smiled  he never learned to swim  saw the little crippled child  and he gave his seat to him  he saw the starlight shining  streaming from the east  death was on the rampage  but his heart was now at peace  they battened down the hatches  but the hatches wouldnt hold  they drowned upon the staircase  of brass and polished gold  leo said to cleo  i think im going mad  but hed lost his mind already  whatever mind he had  he tried to block the doorway  to save all those from harm  blood from an open wound  pouring down his arm  petals fell from flowers  tell all of them were gone  in the long and dreadful hours  the wizards curse played on  the host was pouring brandy  he was going down slow  he stayed right to the end and he  was the last to go  there were many many others  nameless here forever more  they never sailed the ocean  or left their homes before  the watchman he lay dreaming  the damage had been done  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  and he tried to tell someone  the captain barely breathing  kneeling at the wheel  above him and beneath him  fifty thousand tons of steel  he looked over at his compass  and he gazed into its face  needle pointing downward  he knew he lost the race  in the dark illumination  he remembered bygone years  he read the book of revelation  and he filled his cup with tears  when the reapers task had ended  sixteen hundred had gone to rest  the good the bad the rich the poor  the loveliest and the best  they waited at the landing  and they tried to understand  but there is no understanding  for the judgment of gods hand  the news came over the wires  and struck with deadly force  the love had lost its fires  all things had run their course  the watchman he lay dreaming  of all the things that can be  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  into the deep blue sea darkness at the break of noon  shadows even the silver spoon  the handmade blade the childs balloon  eclipses both the sun and moon  to understand you know too soon  there is no sense in trying  pointed threats they bluff with scorn  suicide remarks are torn  from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn  plays wasted words proves to warn  that he not busy being born  is busy dying  temptations page flies out the door  you follow find yourself at war  watch waterfalls of pity roar  you feel to moan but unlike before  you discover that youd just be one more  person crying  so dont fear if you hear  a foreign sound to your ear  its alright ma im only sighing  as some warn victory some downfall  private reasons great or small  can be seen in the eyes of those that call  to make all that should be killed to crawl  while others say dont hate nothing at all  except hatred  disillusioned words like bullets bark  as human gods aim for their mark  make everything from toy guns that spark  to fleshcolored christs that glow in the dark  its easy to see without lookin too far  that not much is really sacred  while preachers preach of evil fates  teachers teach that knowledge waits  can lead to hundreddollar plates  goodness hides behind its gates  but even the president of the united states  sometimes must have to stand naked  and though the rules of the road have been lodged  its only peoples games that you got to dodge  and its alright ma i can make it  advertising signs that con  you into thinking youre the one  that can do whats never been done  that can win whats never been won  meantime life outside goes on  all around you  you lose yourself you reappear  you suddenly find you got nothing to fear  alone you stand with nobody near  when a trembling distant voice unclear  startles your sleeping ears to hear  that somebody thinks they really found you  a question in your nerves is lit  yet you know there is no answer fit  to satisfy ensure you not to quit  to keep it in your mind and not forget  that it is not he or she or them or it  that you belong to  but though the masters make the rules  for the wise men and the fools  i got nothing ma to live up to  for them that must obey authority  that they do not respect in any degree  who despise their jobs their destiny  speak jealously of them that are free  do what they do just to be  nothing more than something they invest in  while some on principles baptized  to strict party platform ties  social clubs in drag disguise  outsiders they can freely criticize  tell nothing except who to idolize  and say god bless him  while one who sings with his tongue on fire  gargles in the rat race choir  bent out of shape from societys pliers  cares not to come up any higher  but rather get you down in the hole  that hes in  but i mean no harm nor put fault  on anyone that lives in a vault  but its alright ma if i cant please him  old lady judges watch people in pairs  limited in sex they dare  to push fake morals insult and stare  while money doesnt talk it swears  obscenity who really cares  propaganda all is phony  while them that defend what they cannot see  with a killers pride security  it blows the minds most bitterly  for them that think deaths honesty  wont fall upon em naturally  life sometimes must get lonely  my eyes collide headon with stuffed  graveyards false goals i scuff  at pettiness which plays so rough  walk upside down inside handcuffs  kick my legs to crash it off  say okay ive had enough  what else can you show me  and if my thoughtdreams could be seen  theyd probably put my head in a guillotine  but its alright ma its life and life only today and tomorrow and yesterday too  the flowers are dyin like all things do  follow me close\\u2005im\\u2005going to ballynalee  ill\\u2005lose my mind if you dont\\u2005come with me  i fuss with my hair and i fight blood feuds  i contain multitudes  got a telltale heart like mr poe  got skeletons in the walls of people you know  ill drink to the truth and the things we said  ill drink to the man that shares your bed  i paint landscapes and i paint nudes  i contain multitudes  a red cadillac and a black mustache  rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash  tell me whats next what shall we do  half my soul baby belongs to you  i rollick and i

you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  i ran into the fortuneteller  who said beware of lightning that might strike  i havent known peace and quiet  for so long i cant remember what its like  theres a lone soldier on the cross  smoke pouring out of a boxcar door  you didnt know it you didnt think it could be done  in the final end he won the war  after losing every battle  i woke up on the roadside  daydreaming about the way things sometimes are  visions of your chestnut mare  shoot through my head and are making me see stars  you hurt the ones that i love best  and cover up the truth with lies  one day youll be in the ditch  flies buzzing around your eyes  blood on your saddle  idiot wind  blowing through the flowers on your tomb  blowing through the curtains in your room  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  it was gravity which pulled us down  and destiny which broke us apart  you tamed the lion in my cage  but it just wasnt enough to change my heart  now everythings a little upside down  as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped  whats good is bad whats bad is good  youll find out when you reach the top  youre on the bottom  i noticed at the ceremony  your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  i cant remember your face anymore  your mouth has changed your eyes dont look into mine  the priest wore black on the seventh day  and sat stonefaced while the building burned  i waited for you on the running boards  near the cypress trees while the springtime turned  slowly into autumn  idiot wind  blowing like a circle around my skull  from the grand coulee dam to the capitol  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  i cant feel you anymore  i cant even touch the books youve read  every time i crawl past your door  i been wishing ive been somebody else instead  down the highway down the tracks  down the road to ecstasy  i followed you beneath the stars  hounded by your memory  and all your raging glory  i been doublecrossed now  for the very last time and now im finally free  i kissed goodbye the howling beast  on the borderline which separated you from me  youll never know the hurt i suffered  nor the pain i rise above  and ill never know the same about you  your holiness or your kind of love  and it makes me feel so sorry  idiot wind  blowing through the buttons of our coats  blowing through the letters that we wrote  idiot wind  blowing through the dust upon our shelves  were idiots babe  its a wonder we can even feed ourselves twas in another lifetime  one of toil and blood  when blackness was a virtue  the road was full of mud  i came in from the wilderness  a creature void of form  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  and if i pass this way again  you can rest assured  ill always do my best for her  on that i give my word  in a world of steeleyed death and men  who are fighting to be warm  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  not a word was spoke between us  there was little risk involved  everything up to that point  had been left unresolved  try imagining a place  where its always safe and warm  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  i was burned out from exhaustion  buried in the hail  poisoned in the bushes  and blown out on the trail  hunted like a crocodile  ravaged in the corn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  suddenly i turned around  and she was standing there  with silver bracelets on her wrists  and flowers in her hair  she walked up to me so gracefully  and took my crown of thorns  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  now theres a wall between us  something theres been lost  i took too much for granted  i got my signals crossed  just to think that it all began  on an uneventful morn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  well the deputy walks on hard nails  and the preacher rides a mount  but nothing really matters much  its doom alone that counts  and the oneeyed undertaker  he blows a futile horn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  ive heard newborn babies wailing  like a mourning dove  and old men with broken teeth  stranded without love  do i understand your question then  is it hopeless and forlorn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  in a little hilltop village  they gambled for my clothes  i bargained for salvation  and she gave me a lethal dose  i offered up my innocence  and i got repaid with scorn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  well im living in a foreign country  but im bound to cross the line  beauty walks a razors edge  someday ill make it mine  if i could only turn back the clock  to when god and her were born  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm aint it just like the night to play tricks when youre tryin to be so quiet  we sit here stranded though were all doin our best to deny it  and louise holds a handful of rain temptin you to defy it  lights flicker from the opposite loft  in this room the heat pipes just cough  the country music station plays soft  but theres nothing really nothing to turn off  just louise and her lover so entwined  and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind  in the empty lot where the ladies play blindmans bluff with the key chain  and the allnight girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train  we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight  ask himself if its him or them thats really insane  louise shes all right shes just near  shes delicate and seems like the mirror  but she just makes it all too concise and too clear  that johannas not here  the ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face  where these visions of johanna have now taken my place  now little boy lost he takes himself so seriously  he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously  and when bringing her name up  he speaks of a farewell kiss to me  hes sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all  muttering small talk at the wall while im in the hall  how can i explain  its so hard to get on  and these visions of johanna they kept me up past the dawn  inside the museums infinity goes up on trial  voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while  but mona lisa musta had the highway blues  you can tell by the way she smiles  see the primitive wallflower freeze  when the jellyfaced women all sneeze  hear the one with the mustache say jeeze  i cant find my knees  oh jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule  but these visions of johanna they make it all seem so cruel  the peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him  sayin name me someone thats not a parasite and ill go out and say a prayer for him  but like louise always says  ya cant look at much can ya man  as she herself prepares for him  and madonna she still has not showed  we see this empty cage now corrode  where her cape of the stage once had flowed  the fiddler he now steps to the road  he writes evrythings been returned which was owed  on the back of the fish truck that loads  while my conscience explodes  the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain  and these visions of johanna are now all that remain oh god said to abraham kill me a son  abe said man you must be puttin me on  god say no  abe say what  god say you can do what you want abe but  the next time you see me comin you better run  well abe said where you want this killin done  god said out on highway   well georgia sam he had a bloody nose  welfare department they wouldnt give him no

said let me think for a minute son  and he said yes i think it can be easily done  just take everything down to highway   now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  told the first father that things werent right  my complexion she says is much too white  he said come here and step into the light  he says hmm youre right  let me tell the second mother this has been done  but the second mother was with the seventh son  and they were both out on highway   now the rovin gambler he was very bored  tryin to create a next world war  he found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  he said i never engaged in this kind of thing before  but yes i think it can be very easily done  well just put some bleachers out in the sun  and have it on highway  listen to that duquesne whistle blowing  blowing

ago a crazy dream came to me  i dreamt i was walking to world war three  i went to the doctor the very next day  to see what kind of words he could say  he said it was a bad dream  i wouldnt worry about it none though  them old dreams are only in your head  i said hold it doc a world war passed through my brain  he said nurse get your pad the boys insane  he grabbed my arm i said ouch  as i landed on the psychiatric couch  he said tell me about it  well the whole thing started at  oclock fast  it was all over by a quarter past  i was down in the sewer with some little lover  when i peeked out from a manhole cover  wondering who turned the lights on us  well i got up and i walked around  up and down the lonesome town  i stood awondering which way to go  i lit a cigarette on a parking meter  and walked on down the road  it was a normal day  well i rung the fallout shelter bell  and i leaned my head and i give a yell  give me a string bean im a hungry man  a shotgun fired and away i ran  i dont blame him too much though he didnt know me  down at the corner by the hotdog stand  i seen a man  i said howdy friend i guess theres just us two  he screamed a bit and away he flew  thought i was a communist  well i spied me a girl and before she could leave  i said lets go and play adam and eve  i took her by the hand and my heart was thumping  when she said hey man you crazy or something  you seen what happened last time they started  well i seen me a cadillac window uptown  there was nobody around  i got into the drivers seat  and i drove down  street  in my cadillac  good car to drive after a war  well i remember seeing some ad  so i turned on my conelrad  but i didnt pay the con ed bill  so the radio didnt work so well  turned on my record player —  it was rockaday johnny singing tell your ma tell your pa  our loves agoing to grow oohwah oohwah  i was feeling kind of lonesome and blue  i needed somebody to talk to  so i called up the operator of time  just to hear a voice of some kind  when you hear the beep it will be three oclock  she said that for over an hour  and i hung up  well the doctor interrupted me just about then  saying hey ive been having the same old dreams  but mine was a little different you see  i dreamt the only person left after the war was me  i didnt see you around  well now time passed and now it seems  everybodys having them dreams  everybody sees their self  walking around with no one else  half of the people can be part right all of the time  and some of the people can be all right part of the time  but all of the people cant be all right all of the time  i think abraham lincoln said that  ill let you be in my dream if i can be in yours  i said that mother of muses sing for me  sing of the mountains and

light and im aslow coming home they sat together in the park  as the evening sky grew dark  she looked at him and he felt a spark  tingle to his bones  twas then he felt alone  and wished that hed gone straight  and watched out for a simple twist of fate  they walked alone by the old canal  a little confused i remember well  and stopped into a strange hotel  with a neon burning bright  he felt the heat of the night  hit him like a freight train  moving with a simple twist of fate  a saxophone someplace faroff played  as she was walking on by the arcade  as the light bust through a beatup shade  where he was wakin up  she dropped a coin into the cup  of a blind man at the gate  and forgot about a simple twist of fate  he woke up the room was bare  he didnt see her anywhere  he told himself he didnt care  pushed the window open wide  felt an emptiness inside  to which he just could not relate  brought on by a simple twist of fate  he hears the ticking of the clocks  and walks along with a parrot that talks  hunts her down by the waterfront docks  where the sailors all come in  maybe shell pick him out again  how long must he wait  one more time for a simple twist of fate  people tell me its a sin  to know and feel too much within  i still believe she was my twin  but i lost the ring  she was born in spring  but i was born too late  blame it on a simple twist of fate my

cheapest labour that money can buy  saddle me up my buckskin mare  if you see me go by put up a prayer   well they rode all night and they rode all day  eastward long down the broad highway  his spirit was tired and his vision was bent  his men deserted him and onward he went  he came to a place where the light was dull  his forehead pounding in his skull  heavy heart was racked with pain  insomnia raging in his brain  well he threw down his helmet and his crosshandled sword  he renounced his faith he denied his lord  crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall  one way or another put an end to it all  he leaned down cut the electric wire  stared into the flames and he snorted the fire  peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two  it was hard to tell for certain who was who  he lowered himself down on a golden chain  his nerves were quaking in every vein  his knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air  he ran his fingers through his greasy hair  they looked at each other and their glasses clinked  one single unit inseparably linked  got a strange premonition theres a man close by   dont worry about him he wouldnt harm a fly   from behind the curtain the boss he crossed the floor  he moved his feet and he bolted the door  shadows hiding the lines in his face  with all the nobility of an ancient race  she turned she was startled with a look of surprise  with a hatred that could hit the skies  youre a reckless fool i could see it in your eyes  to come this way was by no means wise   get up stand up you greedylipped wench  and cover your face or suffer the

wish youd died   the gun went boom and the shot rang clear  first bullet grazed his ear  second ball went right straight in  and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin  he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head  he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed  it would take more than needle and thread  bleeding from the mouth hes as good as dead  you shot my husband down you fiend   husband what husband what the hell do you mean  he was a man of strife a man of sin  i cut him down and threw him to the wind   this she said with angry breath  you too shall meet the lord of death  it was i who brought your soul to life   then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife  his face was hard and caked with sweat  his arms ached and his hands were wet  youre a murderous queen and a bloody wife  if you dont mind ill have the knife   were two of a kind and our blood runs hot  but were no way similar in body or thought  all husbands are good men as all wives know   then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow  his knees went limp and he reached for the door  his tomb was sealed he slid to the floor  he whispered in her ear this is all your fault  my fighting days have come to a halt   she touched his lips and kissed his cheek  he tried to speak but his breath was weak  you died for me now ill die for you   she put the blade to her heart and she ran it through  all three

all the way  a change in the weather is known to be extreme  but whats the sense of changing horses in midstream  im going out of my mind oh oh  with a pain that stops and starts  like a corkscrew to my heart  ever since weve been apart i was riding on the mayflower  when i thought i spied some land  i yelled for captain arab  i have you understand  who came running to the deck  said boys forget the whale  look on over yonder  cut the engines  change the sail  haul on the bowline  we sang that melody  like all tough sailors do  when theyre far away at sea  i think ill call it america  i said as we hit land  i took a deep breath  i fell down i could not stand  captain arab he started  writing up some deeds  he said lets set up a fort  and start buyin a place with beads  just then this cop comes down the street  crazy as a loon  he throws us all in jail  for carrying harpoons  ah me i busted out  dont even ask me how  i went to get some help  i walked by a guernsey cow  who directed me down  to the bowery slums  where people carried signs around  sayin ban the bums  i jumped right into line  sayin i hope that im not late  when i realized i hadnt eaten  for five days straight  i went into a restaurant  looking for the cook  i told him i was the editor  of a famous etiquette book  the waitress he was handsome  he wore a powder blue cape  i ordered some suzette i said  could you please make that crepe  just then the whole kitchen exploded  from boilin fat  food was flyin everywhere  i left without my hat  now i didnt mean to be nosy  but i went into a bank  to get some bail for arab  and all the boys back in the tank  they asked me for some collateral  and i pulled down my pants  they threw me in the alley  when up comes this girl from france  who invited me to her house  i went but she had a friend  who knocked me out  and robbed my boots  and i was on the street again  well i rapped upon a house  with the us flag upon display  i said could you help me out  i got some friends down the way  the man says get out of here  ill tear you limb from limb  i said you know they refused jesus too  he said youre not him  get out of here before i break your bones  i aint your pop  i decided to have him arrested  and i went lookin for a cop  i ran right outside  i hopped inside a cab  i went out the other door  this englishman said fab  as he saw me leap a hot dog stand  and a chariot that stood  parked across from a building  advertising brotherhood  i ran right through the front door  like a hobo sailor does  but it was just a funeral parlor  and the man asked me who i was  i repeated that my friends  were all in jail with a sigh  he gave me his card  he said call me if they die  i shook his hand and said goodbye  ran out to the street  when a bowling ball came down the road  and knocked me off my feet  a pay phone was ringing  and it just about blew my mind  when i picked it up and said hello  this foot came through the line  well by this time is fed up  at tryin to make a stab  at bringing back any help  for my friends and captain arab  i decided to flip a coin  like either heads or tails  would let me know if i should go  back to ship or back to jail  so i hocked my sailor suit  and i got a coin to flip  it came up tails  it rhymed with sails  so i made it back to the ship  well i got back and took  the parking ticket off the mast  i was ripping it to shreds  when this coastguard boat went past  they asked me my name  and i said captain kidd  they believed me but  they wanted to know  what exactly that i did  i said for the pope of eruke  i was employed  they let me go right away  they were very paranoid  well the last i heard of arab  he was stuck on a whale  that was married to the deputy  sheriff of the jail  but the funniest thing was  when i was leavin the bay  i saw three ships sailin  there were all heading my way  i asked the captain what his name was  and how come he didnt drive a truck  he said his name was columbus  i just said good luck while riding on a train going west  i fell asleep for to take my rest  i dreamed a dream that made me sad  concerning myself and the first few friends i had  with halfdamp eyes i stared to the room  where my friends and i spent many an afternoon  where we together weathered many a storm  laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn  by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung  our words was told our songs was sung  where we longed for nothing and were satisfied  jokin and talkin about the world outside  with hungry hearts through the heat and cold  we never much thought we could get very old  we thought we could sit forever in fun  and our chances really was a million to one  as easy it was to tell black from white  it was all that easy to tell wrong from right  and our choices they was few so the thought never hit  that the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split  how many a year has passed and gone  many a gamble has been lost and won  and many a road taken by many a first friend  and each one ive never seen again  i wish i wish i wish in vain  that we could sit simply in that room again  ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat  and id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that im searching for phrases  to sing your praises  i need to tell someone  its soon after midnight  and my day has just begun  a gal named honey  took my money  she was passing by  its soon after midnight  and the moon is in my eye  my heart is cheerful  its never fearful  ive been down on the killing floors  im in no great hurry  im not afraid of your fury  ive faced stronger walls than yours  charlottes a harlot  dresses in scarlet  mary dresses in green  its soon after midnight  and ive got a date with the fairy queen  they chirp and they chatter  what does it matter  theyre lying there dying in their blood  twotiming slim  whos ever heard of him  ill drag his corpse through the mud  its now or never  more than ever  when i met you i didnt think you would do  its soon after midnight  and i dont want nobody but you a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers blood  a finger fired the trigger to his name  a handle hid out in the dark  a hand set the spark  two eyes took the aim  behind a mans brain  but he cant be blamed  hes only a pawn in their game  a south politician preaches to the poor white man  you got more than the blacks dont complain  youre better than them you been born with white skin they explain  and the negros name  is used it is plain  for the politicians gain  as he rises to fame  and the poor white remains  on the caboose of the train  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  the deputy sheriffs the soldiers the governors get paid  and the marshals and cops get the same  but the poor white mans used in the hands of them all like a tool  hes taught in his school  from the start by the rule  that the laws are with him  to protect his white skin  to keep up his hate  so he never thinks straight  bout the shape that hes in  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  from the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks  and the hoof beats pound in his brain  and hes taught how to walk in a pack  shoot in the back with his fist in a clinch  to hang and to lynch  to hide neath the hood  to kill with no pain  like a dog on a chain  he aint agot no name  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught  they lowered him down as a king  but when the shadowy sun sets on the one  that fired the gun  hell see by his grave  on the stone that remains  carved next to his name  his epitaph plain  only a pawn in their game if youre travelin to

you cant come back all the way  only one thing i did wrong  stayed in mississippi a day too long the festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall  the cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall  the curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down  anyone with any sense had already left town  he was standing in the doorway looking like the jack of hearts  he moved across the mirrored room set it up for everyone he said  then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads  then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin  could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins  then he moved into the corner face down like the jack of hearts  backstage the girls were playing fivecard stud by the stairs  lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair  outside the streets were filling up the window was open wide  a gentle breeze was blowing you could feel it from inside  lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts  big jim was no ones fool he owned the towns only diamond mine  he made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine  with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place  he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste  but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts  rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town  she slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown  she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear  sorry darling that im late but he didnt seem to hear  he was staring into space over at the jack of hearts  i know ive seen that face somewhere big jim was thinking to himself  maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf  but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim  and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him  staring at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts  lily was a princess she was fairskinned and precious as a child  she did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled  she had come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs  with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere  but shed never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts  the hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined  the drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind  it was known all around that lily had jims ring  and nothing would ever come between lily and the king  no nothing ever would except maybe the jack of hearts  rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife  she was tired of the attention tired of playing the role of big jims wife  she had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide  was looking to do just one good deed before she died  she was gazing to the future riding on the jack of hearts  lily took her dress off buried it away  has your luck run out she laughed at him well i guess you must  have known it would someday  be careful not to touch the wall theres a brandnew coat of paint  im glad to see youre still alive youre looking like a saint  down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts  the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair  theres something funny going on he said i can just feel it in the air  he went to get the hanging judge but the hanging judge was drunk  as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk  there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts  no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick  the door to the dressing room burst open and a colt revolver clicked  and big jim was standing there ya couldnt say surprised  rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes  she was with big jim but she was leaning to the jack of hearts  two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall  and cleaned out the bank safe its said that they got off with quite a haul  in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground  for one more member who had business back in town  but they couldnt go no further without the jack of hearts  the next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black  big jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back  and rosemary on the gallows she didnt even blink  the hanging judge was sober he hadnt had a drink  the only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts  the cabaret was empty now a sign said closed for repair  lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair  she was thinking bout her father who she very rarely saw  thinking bout rosemary and thinking about the law  but most of all she was thinking bout the jack of hearts a worried man with a worried mind  no one in front of me and nothing behind  theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne  got white skin got assassins eyes  im looking up into the sapphiretinted skies  im well dressed waiting on the last train

face until breaking my eyes  an said what else you got left  yeah it was then that i got up to leave  but she said dont forget  everybody must give something back  for something they get  i stood there and hummed  i tapped on her drum i asked her how come  and she buttoned her boot  and straightened her suit  then she said dont get cute  so i forced my hands in my pockets  and felt with my thumbs  and gallantly handed her  my very last piece of gum  she threw me outside  i stood in the dirt where everyone walked  and after finding out id  forgotten my shirt  i went back and knocked  i waited in the hallway she went to get it  and i tried to make sense  out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  that leaned up against  her jamaican rum  and when she did come i asked her for some  she said no dear  i said your words arent clear  youd better spit out your gum  she screamed til her face got so red  then she fell on the floor  and i covered her up and then  thought id go look through her drawer  and when i was through  i filled up my shoe  and brought it to you  and you you took me in  you loved me then  you never wasted time  and i i never took much  i never asked for

what are you doing out there in the sun anyway  dont you know the sun can burn your brains right out  my enemy crashed into the dust  stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust  he was run down hard and he broke apart  he died in shame he had an iron heart  i wear dark glasses to cover my eyes  there are secrets in em that i cant disguise  come back baby  if i hurt your feelings i apologize  two trains running side by side forty miles wide  down the eastern line  you dont have to go  i just came to you because youre a friend of mine  i think that when my back was turned  the whole world behind me burned  its been a while  since we walked down that long long aisle  we cried on a cold and frosty morn  we cried because our souls were torn  so much for tears  so much for these long and wasted years sixteen years  sixteen banners united over the fields  where the good shepherd grieves  desperate men desperate women divided  spreading their wings neath falling leaves  fortune calls  i stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace  merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down  shes smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born  on midsummers eve near the tower  the coldblooded moon  the captain waits above the celebration  sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  whose ebony face is beyond communication  the captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid  they shaved her head  she was torn between jupiter and apollo  a messenger arrived with a black nightingale  i seen her on the stairs and i couldnt help but follow  follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil  i stumbled to my feet  i rode past destruction in the ditches  with the stitches still mending neath a heartshaped tattoo  renegade priests and treacherous young witches  were handing out the flowers that id given to you  the palace of mirrors  where dog soldiers are reflected  the endless road and the wailing of chimes  the empty rooms where her memory is protected  where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times  she wakes him up  fortyeight hours later the sun is breaking  near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks  shes begging to know what measures he now will be taking  hes pulling her down and shes clutching onto his long golden locks  gentlemen he said i dont need your organization ive shined your shoes  ive moved your mountains and marked your cards  but eden is burning either get ready for elimination  or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards  peace will come  with tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire  but will offer no reward when her false idols fall  and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  between the king and the queen of swords i married isis on the fifth day of may  but i could not hold on to her very long  so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away  for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong  i came to a high place of darkness and light  dividing line ran through the center of town  i hitched up my pony to a post on the right  went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down  a man in the corner approached me for a match  i knew right away he was not ordinary  he said are you looking for something easy to catch  said i got no money  he said that aint necessary  we set out that night for the cold in the north  i gave him my blanket and he gave me his word  i said where are we going he said wed be back by the fourth  i said thats the best news that ive ever heard  i was thinking about turquoise i was thinking about gold  i was thinking about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace  as we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  i was thinking about isis how she thought i was so reckless  how she told me that one day we would meet up again  and things would be different the next time we wed  if i only could hang on and just be her friend  i still cant remember all the best things she said  we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  he said theres a body im trying to find  if i carry it out itll bring a good price  twas then that i knew what he had on his mind  the wind it was ahowlin and the snow was outrageous  we chopped through the night  and we chopped through the dawn  when he died i was hoping that it wasnt contagious  but i made up my mind that i had to go on  i broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  there was no jewels no nothing i felt id been had  when i saw that my partner was just being friendly  when i took up his offer i mustve been mad  i picked up his body and i dragged him inside  threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover  i said a quick prayer then i felt satisfied  then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her  she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes  i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead  she said where you been i said no place special  she said you look different i said well i guess  she said you been gone i said thats only natural  she said you going to stay i said if you want me to yes  isis oh isis you mystical child  what drives me to you is what drives me insane  i still can remember the way that you smiled  on the fifth day of may in the drizzling rain oxford town

pits ran aplenty  but the cardboard filled windows  and old men on the benches  tell you now that the whole town is empty  in the north end of town  my own children are grown  well i was raised on the other  in the wee hours of youth  my mother took sick  and i was brought up by my brother  the iron ore poured  as the years passed the door  the drag lines and the shovels they was ahummin  til one day my brother  failed to come home  the same as my father before him  well a long winters wait  from the winda i watched  my friends they couldnta been kinder  and my school it was cut  as i quit in the spring  to marry john thomas a miner  oh the years passed again  and the givin was good  with the lunch bucket filled every season  what with three babies born  the work was cut down  to a half a days shift with no reason  then the shaft was soon shut  and more work was cut  and the fire in the air it felt frozen  til a man come to speak  and he said in one week  that number eleven was closin  they complained in the east  theyre payin too high  they say that your ore aint worth adiggin  that its much cheaper down  in the south american towns  where the miners work almost for nothin  so the minin gates locked  and the red iron rotted  and the room smelled heavy from drinkin  when the sad silent song  made the hour twice as long  as i waited for the sun to go sinking  i lived by the window  as he talked to himself  this silence of tongues it was buildin  til one mornings wake  the bed it was bare  and is left alone with three children  the summer is gone  the grounds turning cold  the stores one by one theyre afoldin  my children will go  as soon they grow  well there aint nothin here now to hold them perhaps its the color of the sun cut flat  and covering the crossroads im standing at  or maybe its the weather or something like that  but mama you been on my mind  i dont mean trouble please dont put me down or get upset  i am not pleading or saying i cant forget you  i do not pace the floor bowed down and bent but yet  mama you been on my mind  even though my eyes are hazy  and my thoughts they might be narrow  where you been dont bother me  or bring me down with sorrow  i dont even mind who youll be waking with tomorrow  mama youre just on my mind  im not asking you to say words like yes or no  please understand me i have no place im calling you to go  im just whispering to myself so i cant pretend that i dont know  mama you are on my mind  when you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror  you know i wont be next to you you know i wont be near  id just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear  as someone who has had you on his mind down the street the dogs are barkin  and the day is agettin dark  as the night comes in afalling  the dogs will lose their bark  and the silent night will shatter  from the sounds inside my mind  yes im one too many mornings  and a thousand miles behind  from the crossroads of my doorstep  my eyes start to fade  and i turn my head back to the room  where my love and i have laid  and i gaze back to the street  the sidewalk and the sign  and im one too many mornings  and a thousand miles behind  its a restless hungry feeling  that dont mean no one no good  when everything im asayin  you can say it just as good  youre right from your side  im right from mine  were both just one too many mornings  and a thousand miles behind oh the streets of rome are filled with rubble  ancient footprints are everywhere  you can almost think that youre seeing double  on a cold dark night on the spanish stairs  got to hurry on back to my hotel room  where ive got me a date with botticellis niece  she promised that shed be right there with me  when i paint my masterpiece  oh the hours ive spent inside the coliseum  dodging lions and wasting time  oh those mighty kings of the jungle i could hardly stand to see them  yes it sure has been a long hard climb  train wheels running through the back of my memory  when i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese  someday everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody  when i paint my masterpiece  sailing round the world in a dirty gondola  oh to be back in the land of cocacola  i left rome and landed in brussels  on a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried  clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels  everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside  newspapermen eating candy  had to be held down by big police  someday everything is going to be different  when i paint my masterpiece there is a house down in new orleans  they call the rising sun  and its been the ruin of many apoor girl  and me—oh god—im one  my mother was a tailor  she sewed these new blue jeans  my sweetheart was a gambler

well climb that hill no matter how steep  when we get up to it  whooee ride me high  tomorrows the day  my brides going to come  oh oh are we going to fly  down in the easy chair twas down in mississippi no so long ago  when a young boy from chicago town stepped through a southern door  this boys dreadful tragedy i can still remember well  the color of his skin was black and his name was emmett till  some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up  they said they had a reason but i cant remember what  they tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat  there was screaming sounds inside the barn there was laughing sounds out on the street  then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain  and they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain  the reason that they killed him there and im sure it aint no lie  was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die  and then to stop the united states of yelling for a trial  two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor emmett till  but on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime  and so this trial was a mockery but nobody there seemed to mind  i saw the morning papers but i could not bear to see  the smiling brothers walking down the courthouse stairs  for the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free  while emmetts body floats the foam of a jim crow southern sea  if you cant speak out against this kind of thing a crime thats so unjust  your eyes are filled with dead mens dirt your mind is filled with dust  your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains and your blood it must refuse to flow  for you to let this human race fall down so godawful low  this songs just a reminder to remind your fellow man  that this kind of thing still lives today in that ghostrobed ku klux klan  but if all of us folks that thinks alike if we gave all we could give  we could make this great land of ours a greater place to live seen the arrow on the doorpost  saying this land is condemned  all the way from new orleans  to jerusalem  i traveled through east texas  where many martyrs fell  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  well i heard that hoot owl singing  as they were taking down the tents  the stars above the barren trees  was his only audience  them charcoal gypsy maidens  can strut their feathers well  but nobody can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  see them big plantations burning  hear the cracking of the whips  smell that sweet magnolia blooming  see the ghosts of slavery ships  i can hear them tribes moaning  hear that undertakers bell  nobody can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  theres a woman by the river  with some fine young handsome man  hes dressed up like a squire  bootlegged whiskey in his hand  theres a chain gang on the highway  i can hear them rebels yell  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  well god is in his heaven  and we all want whats his  but power and greed and corruptible seed  seem to be all that there is  im gazing out the window  of the st james hotel  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell standing on the waters casting your bread  while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing  distant ships sailing into the mist  you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing  freedom just around the corner for you  but with the truth so far off what good will it do  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  so swiftly the sun sets in the sky  you rise up and say goodbye to no one  fools rush in where angels fear to tread  both of their futures so

michelangelo indeed couldve carved out your features  resting in the fields far from the turbulent space  half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  well the riflemans stalking the sick and the lame  preacherman seeks the same wholl get there first is uncertain

in temperance building high on poachers hill  and red mutant eyes gazed down on hunger city  no more big wheels  fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats  and ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes  coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers  like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of loveme avenue  ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox now legwarmers  family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald  any day now the year of the diamond dogs  this aint rock and roll this is genocide i bless you madly  sadly as i tie my shoes  i love you badly  just in time at times i guess  because of you i need to rest  because its you  that sets the test  so much has gone  and little is new  and as the sparrow sings  dawn chorus for  someone else to hear  the thinker sits alone growing older  and so bitter  i gave them life  i gave them all  they drained my very soul  dry  i crushed my heart  to ease their pains  no thought for me remains there  nothing can they spare  what of me  who praised their efforts  to be free  words of strength and care  and sympathy  i opened doors  that would have blocked their way  i braved their cause to guide  for little pay  i ravaged at my finance just for those  those whose claims were steeped in peace tranquility  those who said a new world new ways ever free  those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me  i bless you madly  sadly as i tie my shoes  i love you badly  just in time at times i guess  because of you i need to rest  because its you  that sets the test  so much has gone  and little is new  and as the sunrise stream  flickers on me  my friends talk  of glory untold dream where all is god and god is just a word  we had a friend a talking man  who spoke of many powers that he had  not of the best of men but ours  we used him  we let him use his powers  we let him fill our needs  now we are strong  and the road is coming to its end  now the damned have no time to make amends  no purse of token fortune stands in our way  the silent guns of love  will blast the sky  we broke the ruptured structure built of age  our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  where money stood  we planted seeds of rebirth  and stabbed the backs of fathers  sons of dirt  infiltrated business cesspools  hating through our sleeves  yea and we slit the catholic throat  stoned the poor  on slogans such as  wish you could hear  love is all we need  kick out the jams  kick out your mother  cut up your friend  screw up your brother or hell get you in the end  and we know the flag of love is from above  and we can force you to be free  and we can force you to believe  and i close my eyes and tighten up my brain  for i once read a book in which the lovers were slain  for they knew not the words of the free states refrain  it said  i believe in the power of good  i believe in the state of love  i will fight for the right to be right  i will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right  and i open my eyes to look around  and i see a child laid slain  on the ground  as a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  ploughing down man woman listening to its command  but not hearing anymore  not hearing anymore  just the shrieks from the old rich  and i want to believe  in the madness that calls now  and i want to believe  that a lights shining through  somehow  and i want to believe  and you want to believe  and we want to believe  and we want to live  oh we want to live  we want to live  we want to live  we want to live  we want to live  i want to

remember you know a long time ago and some article putting you down in rolling stone had just come out  janis joplin yeah  howard smith and you got very upset about that are you still that upset when you are put down in any articles  janis joplin you know i should be able to get past that you know but i mean girls want to be reassured which is not to say that all people dont but i think women especially  i mean even though i know that those are just aholes that dont know what theyre talking about and i should just continue with my music you know and let them either come into the show and listen or go home and beat off i dont care what they do i should be able to beat through that but in my insides it really hurts if someone doesnt like me you know its silly   howard smith because i remember that time you were very upset  janis joplin well that was a pretty heavy time for me it was really important you know whether people were going to accept me or not  howard smith a lot of women have been saying that the whole field of rock music is nothing more than just a big male chauvinist ripoff how do you  janis joplin  yeah  howard smith yeah and when i say well what about janis joplin she made it and they say oh her and it seems to bother a lot of womens lib people that youre kind of so upfront sexually  janis joplin well then thats their problem not mine i havent ever hardly talked with anyone in womens lib i havent been attacked by anyone yet how can they attack me im representing everything they said they want you know what i mean well i have an opinion about this its sort of like you are what you settle for do you know what i mean youre only as much as you settle for if they settle for being somebodys dishwasher thats their own fing problem if you dont settle for that and you keep fighting it you know youll end up anything you want to be how can they attack me im just doing what i wanted to and what feels right and not settling for bulls and it worked how can they be mad at that  howard smith one girl i know said well how come she doesnt have any women in any of her groups  janis joplin  you show me a good drummer and ill hire one show me a good chick besides i dont want any chicks on the road with me  howard smith you dont  janis joplin ive got enough competition man  no i like to be around men   janis joplin did all that s i said about chicks sound bad  howard smith no you said what you wanted to say dont be silly  janis joplin well i dont want to offend people its just that like you know i have a certain set of circumstances i live under like you know all this repressive upbringing and things i had that too you dont think i had a repressive upbringing in port arthur texas its just that it drove me crazy and i kept fighting against it i dont think you can talk anybody into fighting against it if they dont have it in themselves to need more you know what i mean just plain need more then thats that if they do need more theyll get more theyll demand more you know what i mean  howard smith okay thanks a lot  janis joplin sure enough  howard smith okay goodbye  janis joplin bye bye bye bye baby bye bye  i may be seeing

the train tracks through the laundry on the line  im thinking its your business but you dont got to answer  im knockin on your screen door in the summertime  im knockin on your screen door in the summertime jesus the missing years  it was raining it was cold  west bethlehem was no place for a twelveyear old  so he packed his bag and he headed out  to find out what the worlds about  he went to france and went to spain  he found love and he found pain  he found stores so he started to shop  he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop  kids in trouble with the cops from israel didnt have no home  so he cut his hair and moved to rome  it was there he met his irish bride  and they rented a flat on the lower east side of rome  italy that is  music publishers book binders  bible belters swimming pools  orgies and lots of pretty italian chicks  charlie bought some popcorn billy bought a car  someone almost bought the farm but they didnt go that far  things shut down at midnight at least round here they do  cause we all reside down the block inside  skidoo  wine was flowing so were beers  so jesus found his missing years  he went to a dance and said this dont move me  he hiked up his pants and he went to a movie  on his thirteenth birthday he saw rebel without a cause  he went straight on home and invented santa claus  who gave him a gift and he responded in kind  he gave the gift of love and went out of his mind  you see him and the wife wasnt getting along  so he took out his guitar and he wrote a song  called the dove of love fell off the perch  but he couldnt get divorced in the catholic church  at least not back then anyhow  jesus was a good guy  he didnt need this shit  so he took a pill with a cocacola  and he swallowed it  he discovered the beatles  and he recorded with the stones  once he even opened up a threeway package  for old george jones  charlie bought some popcorn billy bought a car  someone almost bought the farm but they didnt go that far  things shut down at midnight at least round here they do  cause we all reside down the block inside of  skidoo  the years went by like sweet little days  with babies crying pork chops and beaujolais  when he woke up he was seventeen  the world was angry the world was mean  why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop  all agreed that life stank all the world smelled like poop  baby poop that is  the worst kind  so he grew his hair long and he threw away his comb  headed back to jerusalem to find mom and dad and home  but when he got there the cupboard was bare  except for an old black man with a fishing rod  he said what you gonna be when you grow up  jesus said god  oh my god what have i gotten myself into  im a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood  theyre gonna kill me mama they dont like me bud  so jesus went to heaven he went there awful quick  all them people killed him he wasnt even sick  so come and gather around me my contemporary peers  and ill tell you all the story of jesus the missing years  charlie bought some popcorn billy bought a car  someone almost bought the farm but they didnt go that far  things shut down at midnight at least round here they do  cause we all reside down the block inside at  skidoo as the cafe was closing on a warm summer night  and cathy was cleaning the spoons  the radio played the hit parade  and i hummed along with the

where the angels sing  aint it funny how an old broken bottle  looks just like a diamond ring  but its far far from me  well i leaned on my left leg in the parking lot dirt  and cathy was closing the lights  a junebug flew from the warmth he once knew  and i wished for once i werent right  why we used to laugh together  and wed dance to any old song  well ya know she still laughs with me  but she waits just a second too long  and the sky is black and still now  on the hill where the angels sing  aint it funny how an old broken bottle  looks just like a diamond ring  but its far far from me  well i started the engine and i gave it some gas  and cathy was closing her purse  well we hadnt gone far in my beatup old car  and i was prepared for the worst  will you still see me tomorrow  no i

ceiling just wanting to be  lay one of too many a young pfc  there were spaces between donald and whatever he said  strangers had forced him to live in his head  he envisioned the details of romantic

heart  hot love cold love no love at all  a portrait of guilt is hung on the wall  nothing is wrong nothing is right  donald and lydia made love that night  they made love in the mountains they made love in the streams  they made love in the valleys they made love in their dreams  but when they were finished there was nothing to say  cause mostly they made love from ten miles away  but dreaming

arrived the same time  i yielded to the man to the right of me  and he yielded it right back to mine  well the yield went around and around and around  till pamela finally tried  just then the man in the light blue sedan  hit pamelas passenger side  they dont know how lucky they are  they could have run into that tree  got struck by a bolt of lightning  and raped by a minority  pamela hit her head on the mirror  mrs walker got a bump on the knee  the man hit himself in the face and said  why does this happen to me  then the neighbors came out and they gathered about  saying hey who hit who anyway  and the police arrived at a quarter to five  and pronounced all the victims okay  but they dont know how lucky they are  they could have run into that tree  got struck by a bolt of lightning  and raped by a minority it got so hot last night i swear  you couldnt hardly breathe  heat lightning burned the sky like alcohol  i sat on the porch without my shoes  and i watched the cars roll by  as the headlights raced to the corner of the kitchen wall  mama dear your boy is here  far across the sea  waiting for that sacred coal  that burns inside of me  and i feel a storm  all wet and warm

goes  everybody knows  everybody knows that the boat is leaking  everybody knows the captain lied  everybody got this broken feeling  like their father or their dog just died  everybody talking to their pockets  everybody wants a box of chocolates  and a longstem rose  everybody knows  and everybody knows that you love me baby  everybody knows that you really do  everybody knows that youve been

spend the night beside her  and you know that shes half crazy  but thats why you want to be there  and she feeds you tea and oranges  that come all the way from china  and just when you mean to tell her  that you have no love to give her  then she gets you on her wavelength  and she lets the river answer  that youve always been her lover  and you want to travel with her  and you want to travel blind  and you know that she will trust you  for youve touched her perfect body with your mind  and jesus was a sailor  when he walked upon the water  and he spent a long time watching  from his lonely wooden tower  and when he knew for certain  only drowning men could see him  he said all men will be sailors then  until the sea shall free them  but he himself was broken  long before the sky would open  forsaken almost human  he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone  and you want to travel with him  and you want to travel blind  and you think maybe youll trust him  for hes touched your perfect body with his mind  now suzanne takes your hand  and she leads you to the river  she is wearing rags and feathers  from salvation army counters  and the sun pours down like honey  on our lady of the harbour  and she shows you where to look  among the garbage and the flowers  there are heroes in the seaweed  there are children in the morning  they are leaning out for love  and they will lean that way forever  while suzanne holds the mirror  and you want to travel with her  and you want to travel blind  and you know you can trust her  for shes touched your perfect body with her mind the birds they sang  at the break of day  start again  i heard them say  dont dwell on what  has passed away  or what is yet to be  yeah the wars they will  be fought again  the holy dove  she will be caught again  bought and sold  and bought again  the dove is never free  ring the bells that still can ring  forget your perfect offering  there is a crack a crack in everything  thats how the light gets in  we asked for signs  the signs were sent  the birth betrayed  the marriage spent  yeah the widowhood  of every government  signs for all to see  i cant run no more  with that lawless crowd  while the killers in high places  say their prayers out loud  but theyve summoned theyve summoned up  a thundercloud  and theyre going to hear from me  ring the bells that still ring  forget your perfect offering  there is a crack a crack in everything  thats how the light gets in  you can add up the parts  you wont have the sum  you can strike up the march  there is no drum  every heart every heart  to love will come  but like a refugee  ring the bells that still can ring  forget your perfect offering  there is a crack a crack in everything  thats how the light gets in  ring the bells that

crumbs of love that you offer me  theyre the crumbs ive left behind  your pain is no credential here  its just the shadow shadow of my wound  i have begun to long for you  i who have no greed  i have begun to ask for you  i who have no need  you say youve gone away from me  but i can feel you when you breathe  do not dress in those rags for me  i know you are not poor  you dont love me quite so

back on the angel too  they oughta give my heart a medal  for letting go of you  when i turned my back on the devil  turned my back on the angel too its true that all the men you knew were dealers  who said they were through with dealing  every time you gave them shelter  i know that kind of man  its hard to hold the hand of anyone  who is reaching for the sky just to surrender  who is reaching for the sky just to surrender  and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind  you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter  like any dealer he was watching for the card  that is so high and wild  hell never need to deal another  he was just some joseph looking for a manger  he was just some joseph looking for a manger  and then leaning on your window sill  hell say one day you caused his will  to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter  and then taking from his wallet  an old schedule of trains hell say  i told you when i came i was a stranger  i told you when i came i was a stranger  but now another stranger seems  to want you to ignore his dreams  as though they were the burden of some other  o youve seen that man before  his golden arm dispatching cards  but now its rusted from the elbow to the finger  and he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter  yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter  ah you hate to watch another tired man  lay down his hand  like he was giving up the holy game of poker  and while he talks his dreams to sleep  you notice theres a highway  that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder  its curling just like smoke above his shoulder  you tell him to come in sit down  but something makes you turn around  the door is open you cant close your shelter  you try the handle of the road  it opens do not be afraid  its you my love you who are the stranger  it is you my love you who are the stranger  well ive been waitin i was sure  wed meet between the trains were waitin for  i think its time to board another  please understand i never had a secret chart  to get me to the heart of this  or any other matter  when he talks like this you dont know what hes after  when he speaks like this you dont know what hes after  lets meet tomorrow if you choose  upon the shore beneath the bridge  that they are building on some endless river  then he leaves the platform  for the sleeping car thats warm  you realize hes only advertising one more shelter  and it comes to you he never was a stranger  and you say ok the bridge or someplace later  and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind  you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter  like any dealer he was watching for the card  that is so high and wild  hell never need to deal another  he was just some joseph looking for a manger  he was just some joseph looking for a manger  and then leaning on your window sill  hell say one day you caused his will  to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter  and then taking from his wallet  an old schedule of trains hell say  i told you when i came i was a stranger  i told you when i came i was a stranger  i told you when i came i was a stranger  i told you when i came i was a stranger come over to the window my little darling  id like to try to read your palm  i used to think i was some kind of gypsy boy  before i let you take me home  now so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  well you know that i love to live with you  but you make me forget so very much  i forget to pray for the angels  and then the angels forget to pray for us  now so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  we met when we were almost young  deep in the green lilac park  you held on to me like i was a crucifix  as we went kneeling through the dark  oh so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  your letters they all say that youre beside me now  then why do i feel alone  im standing on a ledge and your fine spider web  is fastening my ankle to a stone  now so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  for now i need your hidden love  im cold as a new razor blade  you left when i told you i was curious  i never said that i was brave  oh so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  oh you are really such a pretty one  i see youve gone and changed your name again  and just when i climbed this whole mountainside  to wash my eyelids in the rain  oh so long marianne its time that we began  to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again and who by fire who by water  who in the sunshine who in the night time  who by high ordeal who by common trial  who in your merry merry month of may  who by very slow decay  and who shall i say is calling  and who in her lonely slip who by barbiturate  who in these realms of love who by something blunt  and who by avalanche who by powder  who for his greed who for his hunger  and who shall i say is calling  and who by brave assent who by accident  who in solitude who in this mirror  who by his ladys command who by his own hand  who in mortal chains who in power  and who shall i say is calling like a bird on the wire  like a drunk in a midnight choir  i have tried in my way to be free  like a worm on a hook  like a knight from some old fashioned book  i have saved all my ribbons for thee  if i if i have been unkind  i hope that you can just let it go by  if i if i have been untrue  i hope you know it was never to you  like a baby stillborn  like a beast with his horn  i have torn everyone who reached out for me  but i swear by this song  and by all that i have done wrong  i will make it all up to thee  i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch  he said to me you must not ask for so much  and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door  she cried to me hey why not ask for more  oh like a bird on the wire  like a drunk in a midnight choir  i have tried in my way to be free i lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me  but the room just filled up with mosquitos  they heard that my body was free  then i took the dust of a long sleepless night  and i put it in your little shoe  and then i confess that i tortured the dress  that you wore for the world to look through  i showed my heart to the doctor he said i just have to quit  then he wrote himself a perscription  and your name was mentioned in it  then he locked himself in a library shelf  with the details of our honeymoon  and i hear from the nurse that hes gotten much worse  and his practice is all in a ruin  i heard of a saint who had loved you  so i studied all night in his school  he taught that the duty of lovers  is to tarnish the golden rule  and just when i was sure that his teachings were pure  he drowned himself in the pool  his body is gone but back here on the lawn  his spirit continues to drool  an eskimo showed me a movie  hed recently taken of you  the poor man could hardly stop shivering  his lips and his fingers were blue  i suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes  and i guess he just never got warm  but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice  oh please let me come into the storm thanks for the dance  im sorry youre tired  the evening has hardly begun  thanks for the dance  try to look inspired  onetwothree onetwothree one  there is a rose in your hair  your shoulders are bare  youve been wearing this costume forever  so turn up the music  pour out the wine  stop at the surface  the surface is fine  we dont need to go any deeper  thanks for the dance  i hear that were married  onetwothree onetwothree one  thanks for the dance  and the baby you carried  it was almost a daughter or a son  and theres nothing to do  but to wonder if you  are as hopeless as me  and as decent  were joined in the spirit  joined at the hip  joined in the panic  wondering if  weve come to some sort  of agreement  it was fine it was fast  we were first we were last  in line at the  temple of pleasure  but the green was so green  and the blue was so blue  i was so i  and you were so you  the crisis was light  as a feather  thanks for the dance  it was hell it was swell it was fun  thanks for all the dances  onetwothree onetwothree one seemed

its bright the dying spark  go tell the young messiah  what happens to the heart  theres a mist of summer kisses  where i tried to doublepark  the rivalry was vicious  and the women were in charge  it was nothing it was business  but it left an ugly mark  so ive come here to revisit  what happens to the heart  i was selling holy trinkets  i was dressing kind of sharp  had a pussy in the kitchen  and a panther in the yard  in the prison of the gifted  i was friendly with the guard  so i never had to witness  what happens to the heart  i should have seen it coming  you could say i wrote the chart  just to look at her was trouble  it was trouble from the start  sure we played a stunning couple  but i never liked the part  it aint pretty it aint subtle  what happens to the heart  now the angels got a fiddle  and the devils got a harp  every soul is like a minnow  every mind is like a shark  ive opened every window  but the house the house is dark  just say uncle then its simple  what happens to the heart  i was always working steady  but i never called it art  the slaves were there already  the singers chained and charred  now the arc of justice bending  and the injured soon to march  i lost my job defending  what happens to the heart  i studied with this beggar  he was filthy he was scarred  by the claws of many women  he had failed to disregard  no fable here no lesson  no singing meadowlark  just a filthy beggar blessing  what happens to the heart  i was always working steady  but i never called it art  i could lift but nothing heavy  almost lost my union card  i was handy with a rifle  my fathers   we fought for something final  not the right to disagree  sure it failed my little fire  but its bright the dying spark  go tell the young messiah  what happens to the heart  june   oh the sisters of mercy they are not departed or gone  they were waitin for me when i thought that i just cant go on  and they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song  oh i hope you run into them you whove been travelling so long  yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control  it begins with your family but soon it comes round to your soul  well ive been where youre hanging i think i can see how youre pinned  when youre not feeling holy your loneliness says that youve sinned  well they lay down beside me i made my confession to them  they touched both my eyes and i touched the dew on their hem  if your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn  they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem  when i left they were sleeping i hope you run into them soon  dont turn on the lights you can read their address by the moon  and you wont make me jealous if i hear that they sweetened your night  we werent lovers like that and besides it would still be all right  we werent lovers like that and besides it would still be all right well my friends are gone and my hair is grey  i ache in the places where i used to play  and im crazy for love but im not coming on  im just paying my rent every day  in the tower of song  i said to hank williams how lonely does it get  hank williams hasnt answered yet  but i hear him coughing all night long  oh a hundred floors above me  in the tower of song  i was born like this i had no choice  i was born with the gift of a golden voice  and twentyseven angels from the great beyond  they tied me to this table right here  in the tower of song  so you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll  im very sorry baby doesnt look like me at all  im standing by the window where the light is strong  ah they dont let a woman kill you  not in the tower of song  now you can say that ive grown bitter but of this you may be sure  the rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor  and theres a mighty judgement coming but i may be wrong  you see you hear these funny voices  in the tower of song  i see you standing on the other side  i dont know how the river got so wide  i loved you baby way back when  and all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed  but i feel so close to everything that we lost  well never well never have to lose it again  now i bid you farewell i dont know when ill be back  there moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track  but youll be hearing from me baby long after im gone  ill be speaking to you sweetly from a window  in the tower of song  yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey  i ache in the places where i used to play  and im crazy for love but im not coming on  im just paying my rent every day  in the tower of song i wish there was a treaty we could sign  its over now the water and the wine  we were broken then but now were borderline  and i wish there was a treaty  i wish there was a treaty between your love and mine i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm  your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm  yes many loved before us i know that we are not new  in city and in forest they smiled like me and you  but now its come to distances and both of us must try  your eyes are soft with sorrow  hey thats no way to say goodbye  im not looking for another as i wander in my time  walk me to the corner our steps will always rhyme  you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me  its just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea  but lets not talk of love or chains and things we cant untie  your eyes are soft with sorrow  hey thats no way to say goodbye  i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm  your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm  yes many loved before us i know that we are not new  in city and in forest they smiled like me and you  but lets not talk of love or chains and things we cant untie  your eyes are soft with sorrow  hey thats no way to say goodbye i believe that you heard your master sing  when i was sick in bed  i suppose that he told you everything  that i keep locked away in my head  your master took you travelling  well at least thats what you said  and now do you come back to bring  your prisoner wine and bread  you met him at some temple  where they take your clothes at the door  he was just a numberless man in a chair  whod just come back from the war  and you wrap up his tired face in your hair  and he hands you the apple core  then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare  of all the kisses we put on some time before  and he gave you a german shepherd to walk  with a collar of leather and nails  and he never once made you explain or talk  about all of the little details  such as who had a word and who had a rock  and who had you through the mails  now your love is a secret all over the block  and it never stops not even when your master fails  and he took you up in his aeroplane  which he flew without any hands  and you cruised above the ribbons of rain  that drove the crowd from the stands  then he killed the lights in a lonely lane  and an ape with angel glands  erased the final wisps of pain  with the music of rubber bands  and now i hear your master sing  you kneel for him to come  his body is a golden string  that your body is hanging from  his body is a golden string  my body has growin numb  oh now you hear your master sing  your shirt is all undone  and will you kneel beside this bed  that we polished so long ago  before your master chose instead  to make my bed of snow  your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red  and youre speaking far too low  no i cant make out what your master said  before he made you go  now i think youre playing far too rough  for a lady whos been to the moon  ive lain by this window long enough  to get used to an empty room  and your love is some dust in an old mans cough  who is tapping his foot to a tune  and your thighs are a ruin you want too much  lets say you came back some time too soon  now i loved your master perfectly  i taught him all that he knew  he was starving in some deep mystery  like a man who is sure what is true  and i sent you to him with my guarantee  i could teach him something new  and i taught him how you would long for me  no matter what he said no matter what youd do  now i believe that you heard your master sing  while i was sick in bed  im sure that he told you everything  i must keep locked away in my head  your master took you travelling  well at least thats what you said  and now do you come back to bring  your prisoner wine and bread lets sing another song boys this one has grown old and bitter  ah his fingernails i see theyre broken  his ships theyre all on fire  the moneylenders lovely little daughter  ah shes eaten shes eaten with desire  she spies him through the glasses  from the pawnshops of her wicked father  she hails him with a microphone  that some poor singer just like me had to leave her  she tempts him with a clarinet  she waves a nazi dagger  she finds him lying in a heap  she wants to be his woman  he says yes i just might go to sleep  but kindly leave leave the future  leave it open  he stands where it is steep  oh i guess he thinks that hes the very first one  his hands upon his leather belt now  like it was the wheel of some big ocean liner  and she will learn to touch herself so well  as all the sails burn down like paper  and he has lit the chain  of his famous cigarillo  ah theyll never theyll never ever reach the moon  at least not the one that were after  its floating broken on the open sea look out there my friends  and it carries no survivor  but lets leave these lovers wondering  why they cannot have each other  and lets sing another song boys  this one has grown old and bitter intro  baby ive been waiting  ive been waiting night and day  i didnt see the time  yeah i waited half my life away  there

when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil  that i had to draw aside to see  the serpent eat its tail  some women wait for jesus and some women wait for cain  so i hang upon my altar  and i hoist my axe again  and i take the one who finds me back to where it all began  when jesus was the honeymoon  and cain was just the man  and we read from pleasant bibles that are bound in blood and skin  that the wilderness is gathering  all its children back again  the rain falls down on last years man  an hour has gone by  and he has not moved his hand  but everything will happen if he only gives the word  the lovers will rise up  and the mountains touch the ground  but the skylight is like skin for a drum ill never mend  and all the rain falls down amen  on the works of last years man she said she was a maiden  that wasnt what i heard  for the sake of conversation  i took\\u2005her\\u2005at her word  the\\u2005lights went out behind us  the fireflies\\u2005undressed  the broken sidewalk ended  i touched her sleeping breasts  they opened to me urgently  like lilies from the dead  behind a fine embroidery  her nipples rose like bread  then i took off my necktie  and she took off her dress  my belt and pistol set aside  we tore away the rest  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  so i took her to the river  as any man would do  her thighs they slipped away from me  like schools of startled fish  though ive forgotten half my life  i still remember this  now as a man i wont repeat  the things she said aloud  except for this my lips are sealed forever  and for now  and soon theres sand in every kiss  and soon the dawn is ready  and soon the night surrenders  to a daffodil machete  i gave her something pretty  and i waited till she laughed  i wasnt born a gypsy  to make a woman sad  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  i took her to the river  as any man would do  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  i took her to the river  as any man would do  i didnt fall in love of course  its never up to you  but she was walking back and forth  and i was passing through  when i took her to the river  in her virginal apparel  when i took her to the river  on that night of santiago  and yes she lied about it all  her children and her husband  you were born to judge the world  forgive me but i wasnt  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  i took her to the river  as any man would do  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  i took her to the river  as any man would do  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  so i took her to the river  as any man would do  the night of santiago  and i was passing through  so i took her to the river  as any man would do \\u200b\\u200bintro\\u200b\\u200b

fidel castro to abandon fields and castles  leave it all and like a man  come back to nothing special  such as waiting rooms ticket lines  silver bullet suicides  and messianic ocean tides  and racial rollercoaster rides  and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry  i know you need your sleep now  i know your lifes been hard  but many men are falling  where you promised to stand guard  i never asked but i heard you cast your lot along with the poor  but then i overheard your prayer  that you be this and nothing more  than just some grateful faithful womans favourite singing millionaire  the patron saint of envy and the grocer of despair  working for the yankee dollar  i know you need your sleep now  i know your lifes been hard  but many men are falling  where you promised to stand guard  ah lover come and lie with me if my lover is who you are  and be your sweetest self awhile until i ask for more my child  then let the other selves be wrong yeah let them manifest and come  till every taste is on the tongue  till love is pierced and love is hung  and every kind of freedom done then  oh my love oh my love oh my love  oh my love oh my love oh my love  oh oh my love o gather up the brokenness and bring it to me now  the fragrance of those promises you never dared to vow  the splinters that you carry the cross you left behind  come healing of the body  come healing of the mind  and let the heavens hear it the penitential hymn  come healing of the spirit  come healing of the limb  behold the gates of mercy in arbitrary space  and none of us deserving the cruelty or the grace  o solitude of longing where love has been confined  come healing of the body  come healing of the mind  o see the darkness yielding that tore the light apart  come healing of the reason  come healing of the heart  o troubled dust concealing an undivided love  the heart beneath is teaching to the broken heart above  o let the heavens falter and let the earth proclaim  come healing of the altar  come healing of the name  o longing of the branches to lift the little bud  o longing of the arteries to purify the blood  and let the heavens hear it the penitential hymn  come healing of the spirit  come healing of the limb  o let the heavens hear it the penitential hymn  come healing of the spirit  come healing of the limb i caught the darkness  it was drinking from your cup  i caught the

refuse  he will speak these words of wisdom  like a sage a man of vision  though he knows hes really nothing  but the brief elaboration of a tube  going home without my sorrow  going home sometime tomorrow  going home to where its better  than before  going home without my burden  going home behind the curtain  going home without this costume  that i wore  he wants to write a love song  an anthem of forgiving  a manual for living  with defeat  a cry above the suffering  a sacrifice recovering  but that isnt what i need him  to complete  i want him to be certain  that he doesnt have a burden  that he doesnt need a vision  that he only has permission  to do my instant bidding which is to  say what i have told him to repeat  going home without my sorrow  going home sometime tomorrow  going home to where its better than before  going home without my burden  going home behind the curtain  going home without the costume that i wore  im going home without my sorrow  going home

 no moon to keep her armour bright  no man to get her through this very smoky night  she said im tired of the war  i want the kind of work i had before  a wedding dress or something white  to wear upon my swollen appetite  well im glad to hear you talk this way  you know ive watched you riding every day  and something in me yearns to win  such a cold and lonesome heroine  and who are you she sternly spoke  to the one beneath the smoke  why im fire he replied  and i love your solitude i love your pride  then fire make your body cold  im going to give you mine to hold  saying this she climbed inside  to be his one to be his only bride  and deep into his fiery heart  he took the dust of joan of arc  and high above the wedding guests  he hung the ashes of her wedding dress  it was deep into his fiery heart  he took the dust of joan of arc  and then she clearly understood  if he was fire oh then she must be wood  i saw her wince i saw her cry  i saw the glory in her eye  myself i long for love and light  but must it come so cruel and oh so bright i saw some people starving  there was murder there was rape  their villages were burning  they were trying to escape  i couldnt meet their glances  i was staring at my shoes  it was acid it was tragic  it was almost like the blues  it was almost like the blues  i have to die a little  between each murderous thought  and when im finished thinking  i have to die a lot  theres torture and theres killing  and theres all my bad reviews  the war the children missing  lord its almost like the blues  its almost like the blues  so i let my heart get frozen  to keep away the rot  my father says im chosen  my mother says im not  i listened to their story  of the gypsies and the jews  it was good it wasnt boring  it was almost like the blues  it was almost like the blues  there is no god in heaven  and there is no hell below  so says the great professor  of all there is to know  but ive had the invitation  that a sinner cant refuse  and its almost like salvation  its almost like the blues  its almost like the blues  almost like the blues i loved you for a long long time  i know this love is real  it dont matter how

scriptures  its written there in blood  i even heard the angels declare it from above  there aint no cure  there aint no cure there aint no cure for love  there aint no cure for love  there aint no

from my tongue  whatever useless things these hands have done  let me see your beauty broken down  like you would do for one you love  your body like a searchlight  my poverty revealed  i would like to try your charity  until you cry now you must try my greed  and everything depends upon  how near you sleep to me  just take this longing from my tongue  all the lonely things my hands have done  let me see your beauty broken down  like you would do for one you love  hungry as an archway  through which the troops have passed  i stand in ruins behind you  with your winter clothes your broken sandal straps  i love to see you naked over there  especially from the back  oh take this longing from my tongue  all the useless things my hands have done  untie for me your hired blue gown  like you would do for one you love  youre faithful to the better man  im afraid that he left  so let me judge your love affair  in this very room where i have sentenced mine to death  ill even wear these old laurel leaves  that hes shaken from his head  just take this longing from my tongue  all the useless things my hands have done  let me see your beauty broken down  like you would do for one you love  like you would do for one you love maybe im still hurting  i cant turn the other cheek  but you know i still love you  its just that i cant speak  i looked for you in everyone  and they called me on that too  i lived alone but i was only  coming back to you  ah theyre shutting down the factory now  just when all the bills are due  and the fields theyre under lock and key  tho the rain and the sun come through  and springtime starts but then it stops  in the name of something new  and all the senses rise against this  coming back to you  and theyre handing down my sentence now  and i know what i must do  another mile of silence while im  coming back to you  there are many in your life  and many still to be  since you are a shining light  theres many that youll see  but i have to deal with envy  when you choose the precious few  whove left their pride on the other side of  coming back to you  even in your arms i know  ill never get it right  even when you bend to give me  comfort in the night  ive got to have your word on this  or none of it is true  and all ive said was just instead of  coming back to you you thought that it could never happen  to all the people that you became  your body lost in legend the beast so very tame  but here right here  between the birthmark and the stain  between the ocean and your open vein  between the snowman and the rain  once again once again  love calls you by your name  the women in your scrapbook  whom you still praise and blame  you say they chained you to your fingernails  and you climb the halls of fame  oh but here right here  between the peanuts and the cage  between the darkness and the stage  between the hour and the age  once again once again  love calls you by your name  shouldering your loneliness  like a gun that you will not learn to aim  you stumble into this movie house  then you climb you climb into the frame  yes and here right here  between the moonlight and the lane  between the tunnel and the train  between the victim and his stain  once again once again  love calls you by your name  i leave the lady meditating  on the very love which i i do not wish to claim  i journey down the hundred steps  but the street is still the very same  and here right here  between the dancer and his cane  between the sailboat and the drain  between the newsreel and your tiny pane  once again once again  love calls you by your name  where are you judy where are you anne  where are the paths your heroes came  wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away  was i was i only limping was i really lame  oh here come over here  between the windmill and the grain  between the sundial and the chain  between the traitor and her pain  once again once again  love calls you by your name i saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary  do you hate mankind for what they done to you  he said talk of love not hate things to do  its getting late  ive so little time and im only passin through  passin through passin through  sometimes happy sometimes blue  glad that i ran into you  tell the people that you saw me passin through  i saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand  i said now youre out what are

forge shiverin in the snow  i said how come the men here suffer like they do  men will suffer men will fight even die for what is right  even though they know theyre only passin through  passin through passin through   i was by franklin roosevelts side on the night before he died  he said one world must come out of world war two   yankee russian white or tan he said a man is still a man  were all on one road and were only passin through  passin through passin through  the stories of the street are mine the spanish voices laugh  the cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas  and i lean from my window sill in this old hotel i chose  yes one hand on my suicide one hand on the rose  i know youve heard its over now and war must surely come  the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone  but let me ask you one more time o children of the dusk  all these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us  and where do all these highways go now that we are free  why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me  o lady with your legs so fine o stranger at your wheel  you are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal  the age of lust is giving birth and both the parents ask  the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass  and now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite  and one eye filled with blueprints one eye filled with night  o come with me my little one we will find that farm  and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm  and if by chance i wake at night and i ask you who i am  o take me to the slaughterhouse i will wait there with the lamb  with one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl  i balance on a wishing well that all men call the world  we are so small between the stars so large against the sky  and lost among the subway crowds i try to catch your eye ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread  i never even knew how much i wanted you she said  his muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete  o baby i have come too late she knelt beside his feet  ill never see a face like yours in years of men to come  ill never see such arms again in wrestling or in love  and all his virtues burning in the smoky holocaust  she took unto herself most everything her lover lost  now the master of this landscape he was standing there at the view  with a sparrow of st francis that he was preaching to  she beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood  she said ill make a place between my legs ill show you solitude  he offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room  he promised her protection for the issue of her womb  she moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon  she stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon  she took his much admired oriental frame of mind  and the heartofdarkness alibi his money hides behind  she took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine   this mental space is occupied and everything is mine  he tried to make a final stand beside the railway track  she said the art of longings over and its never coming back  she took his tavern parliament his cap his cocky dance  she mocked his female fashions and his workingclass moustache  now the last time that i saw him he was trying hard to get  a womans education but hes not a woman yet  and the last time that i saw her she was living with some boy  who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy  so the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed  it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed  its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  i guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far  its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  i guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far  its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  i guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far german puppets burnt the jews

marble and the snow  i said mother im frightened  the thunder and the lightning  ill never come through this alone  she said ill be with you  my shawl wrapped around you  my hand on your head when you go  and the night came on  it was very calm  i wanted the night to go on and on  but she said go back go back to the world  we were fightin in egypt  when they signed this agreement  that nobody else had to die  there was this terrible sound  my father went down  with a terrible wound in his side  he said try to go on  take my books take my gun  remember my son how they lied  and the night comes on  its very calm  id like to pretend that my father was wrong  but you dont want to lie not to the young  we were locked in this kitchen  i took to religion  and i wondered how long she would stay  i needed so much  to have nothing to touch  ive always been greedy that way  but my son and my daughter  climbed out of the water  crying papa you promised to play  and they lead me away  to the great surprise  its papa dont peek papa cover your eyes  and they hide they hide in the world  now i look for her always  im lost in this calling  im tied to the threads of some prayer  saying when will she summon me  when will she come to me  what must i do to prepare  when she bends to my longing  like a willow like a fountain  she stands in the luminous air  and the night comes on  its very calm  i lie in her arms she says when im gone  ill be yours yours for a song  now the crickets are singing  the vesper bells ringing  the cats curled asleep in his chair  ill go down to bills bar  i can make it that far  and ill see if my friends are still there  yes and heres to the few  who forgive what you do  and the fewer who dont even care  and the night comes on  its very calm  i want to cross over i want to go home  but she says go back go back to the world i was born in chains  but i was taken out of egypt  i was bound to a burden  but the burden it was raised  lord i can no longer  keep this secret  blessed is the name  the name be praised  i fled to the edge  of the mighty sea of sorrow  pursued by the riders  of a cruel and dark regime  but the waters parted  and my soul crossed over  out of egypt  out of pharaohs dream  word of words  and measure of all measures  blessed is the name  the name be blessed  written on my heart  in burning letters  thats all i know  i cannot read the rest  i was idle with my soul  when i heard you could use me  i followed very closely  but my life remained the same  but then you showed me  where you had been wounded  in every atom  broken is the name  i was alone on the road  and your love was so confusing  all my teachers told me  i had myself to blame  but in the grip of  sensual illusion  a sweet unknowing  unified the name  word of words  and measure of all measures  blessed is the name  the name be blessed  written on my heart  in burning letters  thats all i know  i cannot read the rest  ive heard the soul unfolds  in the chambers of its longing  and the bitter liquor sweetens  in the hammered cup  but all the ladders  of the night have fallen  only darkness now  to lift the longing up  word of words  and measure of all measures  blessed is the name  the name be blessed  written on my heart  in burning letters  thats all i know  i cannot read the rest now the captain called me to his bed  he fumbled for my hand  take these silver bars he said  im giving you command  command of what theres no one here  theres only you and me   all the rest are dead or in retreat  or with the enemy  complain complain thats all youve done  ever since we lost  if its not the crucifixion  then its the holocaust  may christ have mercy on your soul  for making such a joke  amid these hearts that burn like coal  and the flesh that rose like smoke  i know that you have suffered lad  but suffer this awhile  whatever makes a soldier sad  will make a killer smile  im leaving captain ive got to go  theres blood upon your hand  but tell me captain if you know  of a decent place to stand  there is no decent place to stand  in a massacre  but if a woman take your hand  then go and stand with her  i left a wife in tennessee  and my baby in saigon   i risked my life but not to hear  some countrywestern song  ah but if you cannot raise your love  to a very high degree  then youre just the man ive been thinking of   so come and stand with me  your standing days are done i cried  youll rally me no more  i dont even know what side  we fought on or what for  im on the side thats always lost  against the side of heaven  im on the side of snakeeyes tossed  against the side of seven  and ive read the bill of human rights  and some of it was true  but there wasnt any burden left  so im laying it on you  now the captain he was dying  but

silk in the hinge of her thighs  where i have to go begging in beautys disguise  oh goodnight goodnight my night after night  my night after night after night after night after night  i am so afraid that i listen to you  your sun glassed protectors they do that to you  its their ways to detain their ways to disgrace  their knee in your balls and their fist in your face  yes and long live the

fine  for a while  i choose the rooms that i live in with care  the windows are small and the walls almost bare  theres only one bed and theres only one prayer  i listen all night for your step on the stair  but i know from your eyes  and i know from your smile  that tonight will be fine  will be fine will be fine will be fine  for a while  oh sometimes i see her undressing for me  shes the soft naked lady love meant her to be  and shes moving her body so brave and so free  if ive got to remember thats a fine memory  and i know from her eyes  and i know from her smile  that tonight will be fine  will be fine will be fine will be fine  for a while the walls of this hotel are paperthin  last night i heard you making love to him  the struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb  the grunt of unity when he came in  i stood there with my ear against the wall  i was not seized by jealousy at all  in fact a burden lifted from my soul  i learned that love was out of my control  a heavy burden lifted from my soul  i learned that love was out of my control  i listened to your kisses at the door  i never heard the world so clear before  you ran your bath and you began to sing  i felt so good i couldnt feel a thing  i stood there with my ear against the wall  i was not seized by jealousy at all  in fact a burden lifted from my soul  i heard that love was out of my control  a heavy burden

from the winter  your legs all white from the winter  andyour legs all white from the winter i stumbled out of bed  i got ready for the struggle  i smoked a cigarette  and i tightened up my gut  i said this cant be me  must be my double  and i cant forget   i cant forget   i cant forget but i dont remember what  im burning up the road  im heading down to phoenix  i got this old address  of someone that i knew  it was high and fine and free  ah you should have seen us  and i cant forget   i cant forget   i cant forget but i dont remember who  ill be there today  with a big bouquet of cactus  i got this rig that runs on memories  and i promise cross my heart  theyll never catch us  but if they do just tell them it was me  yeah i loved you all my life  and thats how i want to end it  the summers almost gone  the winters tuning up  yeah the summers gone  but a lot goes on forever  and i cant forget   i cant forget   i cant forget but i dont remember what i came by myself to a very crowded place  i was looking for someone who had lines in her face  i found her there but she was past all concern  i asked her to hold me i said lady unfold me  but she scorned me and she told me  i was dead and i could never return  well i argued all night like so many have before  saying whatever you give me i seem to need so much more  then she pointed at me where i kneeled on her floor  she said dont try to use me or slyly refuse me  just win me or lose me  it is this that the darkness is for  i cried oh lady midnight i fear that you grow old  the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold  if we cry now she said it will just be ignored  so i walked through the morning sweet early morning  i could hear my lady calling  youve won me youve won me my lord  youve won me youve won me my lord  yes youve won me youve won me my lord  ah youve won me youve won me my lord  ah youve won me youve won me my lord now i greet you from the other side  of sorrow and despair  with a love so vast and shattered  it will reach you everywhere  and i sing this for the captain  whose ship has not been built  for the mother in confusion  her cradle still unfilled  for the heart with no companion  for the soul without a king  for the prima ballerina  who cannot dance to anything  through the days of shame that are coming  through the nights of wild distress  though your promise count for nothing  you must keep it nonetheless  you must keep it for the captain  whose ship has not been built  for the mother in confusion  her cradle still unfilled  for the heart with no companion  for the soul without a king  for the prima ballerina  who cannot dance to anything  and i greet you from the other side  of sorrow and despair  with a love so vast and shattered  it will reach you everywhere she stands before you naked  you can see it you can taste it  and she comes to you light as the breeze  now you can drink it or you can nurse it  it dont matter how you worship  as long as youre  down on your knees  so i knelt there at the delta  at the alpha and the omega  at the cradle of the river and the seas  and like a blessing come from heaven  for something like a second  i was healed and my heart  was at ease  ah baby i waited  so long for your kiss  for something to happen  oh something like this  and youre weak and youre harmless  and youre sleeping in your harness  and the wind going wild  in the trees  and it aint exactly prison  but youll never be forgiven  for whatever youve done  with the keys  ah baby i waited  so long for your kiss  for something to happen  oh something like this  its dark now and its snowing  o my love i must be going  the river has started to freeze  and im sick of pretending  im broken from bending  ive lived too long on my knees  then she dances so graceful  and your hearts hard and hateful  and shes naked  but thats just a tease  and you turn in disgust  from your hatred and from your love  and she comes to you  light as the breeze  ah baby i waited  so long for your kiss  for something to happen  oh something like this  something like this  theres blood on every bracelet  you can see it you can taste it  and its please baby  please baby please  and she says drink deeply pilgrim  but dont forget theres still a woman  beneath this  resplendent chemise  so i knelt there at the delta  at the alpha and the omega  i knelt there like one who believes  and the blessings come from heaven  and for something like a second  im cured and my heart  is at ease why dont you try to do without him  why dont you try to live alone  do you really need his hands for your passion  do you really need his heart for your throne  do you need his labor for your baby  do you need his beast for the bone  do you need to hold a leash to be a lady  i know youre gonna make it make it on your own  why dont you try to forget him  just open up your dainty little hand  you know this life is filled with many sweet companions  many satisfying onenight stands  do you want to be the ditch around a tower  do you want to be the moonlight in his cave  do you want to give your blessing to his power  as he goes whistlin past his daddy past his daddys grave  id like to take you to the ceremony  well that is if i remember the way  you see jack and jill theyre gotta join their misery  and im afraid its time for everyone to pray  you can see theyve finally taken cover  theyre willing yeah theyre willing to obey  their vows are difficult theyre for each other  so let nobody put a loophole a loophole in their way',\n",

in place  just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow  so i ran fearing not where id go  when a flower grows wild it can always survive  wildflowers dont care where they grow  and the flowers i knew in the fields where i grew  were content to be lost in the crowd  they were common and close i had no room for growth  and i wanted so much to branch out  so i uprooted myself from my homeground and left  took my dreams and i took to the road  when a flower grows wild it can always survive  wildflowers dont care where they grow  i grew up fast and wild and i never felt right  in a garden so different from me  i just never belonged i just longed to be gone  so the garden one day set me free  i hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend  i just let him decide where wed go  when a flower grows wild it can always survive  wildflowers dont care where they grow  just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold  no regret for the path that i chose  when a flower grows wild it can always survive  wildflowers dont care where they grow ive been cheated  been mistreated  when will i be loved  ive been put down  ive been pushed round  when will i be loved  when i find a new man  that i want for mine  he always breaks my heart in two  it happens every time  ive been made blue  ive been lied to  when will i be loved  when i find a new man  that i want for mine  he always breaks my heart in two  it happens every time  oh ive been cheated  been mistreated  when will i be loved  when will i be loved  tell me when will i be loved written by karla bonoff  ©  seagrape music

galley is empty the stove pots are cooling  whats left of the stew  the time is approaching the captain moves over  the hangman steps in to do what hes paid for  with the wind down the tide  she goes proud ahead steaming  and he drives her hard into the shore  so far from the clyde  together we ride  we did ride  as if to a wave from her bows to her rudder  bravely she rises to meet with the land  under their feet you can feel her keel shudder  the shallow sea washes their hands  later the captain shakes hands with the hangman  climbs slowly down to the oily wet ground  goes back to the car that has come here to take him  through the graveyard back to the town  so far from the   together we ride  we did ride  they pull out her cables and hack off her hatches  too poor to be wasteful with pity or time  they swarm on her carcass with torches and axes  like a whale on a bloody shoreline  stripped of her pillars her stays and her stanchions  when its only her bones on the wet poison land  steel ropes will drag her with winches and engines  til its only a stain on the sea  so far from the   together we ride  we did ride  so far from the   together we ride  we did ride we run along easy at periscope depth  sun dappling through clear water  so went the dream of the drowned submariner  far away from the slaughter  your hair is a strawflower that sings in the sun  my darling my beautiful daughter  so went the dream of the drowned submariner  cast away on the water  from down in the vault down in the grave  reaching up to the light on the waves  so she did run to him over the grass  she fell in his arms and he caught her  so went the dream of the drowned submariner  far away on the water  far away on the water i got shot off my horse  so what im up again  playin in one of

music floating in across the bay  hes half listening and wondering  how he could have let her slip away  so long ago but still he wants to know  if anyone has seen her  and hes sitting out in the night  looking down upon the lights of taormina  they were young and love was shining  like the colours of the rainbow  desire felt like choking  love was smoking under the volcano  he can still taste her kisses  sweet as the red wine from messina  now hes sitting out in the night  looking down upon the lights of taormina  seems like another lifetime  when they rambled along the shore  seems like another lifetime  she used to call him her sweet senor  maybe in another lifetime  on a pathway to the sea  maybe there theyll be  the crowd calls for the emperor  raise their hands to hail another king  but hes been so long a wanderer  another crowd can never mean a thing  he came he saw he conquered  ten thousand voices roared in the arena  now hes sitting out in the night  looking down upon the lights of taormina  he hears the chimes of history  myths of gods and men forever ringing  ancient dreams in all their mystery  wars for sicily and spartan women  in the mists of antiquity  ships of war set sail from carthagina  now hes sitting out in the night  looking down upon the lights of taormina  sitting out in the night  looking down upon the lights of taormina brew the coffee in a

falls  tie up in the haven by the old harbor wall  and the hardbitten stranger deaf as a post  who stands at the fire where a poets dreams roast  he cant know the story he cant feel the pain  and all of the glory falls around him like rain  in the sky  in the sky  youre a light in the dark beacon of hope  and strong as a sea boat strong as a rope  and the vagabond wind whispers over the bay  and the songs and the laughter are carried away  in the sky  in the sky  in the sky  in the sky in summer sixty three i was staying alive  hanging at the races hoping to drive  when they were done with

could see the thrashers coming  and the water  shone like diamonds in the dew  and i was just getting up  hit the road before its light  trying to catch an hour on the sun  when i saw  those thrashers rolling by  looking more than two lanes wide  i was feeling  like my day had just begun  where the eagle glides descending  theres an ancient river bending  through the timeless gorge of changes  where sleeplessness awaits  i searched out my companions  who were lost in crystal canyons  when the aimless blade of science  slashed the pearly gates  it was then i knew id had enough  burned my credit card for fuel  headed out to where the pavement  turns to sand  with a oneway ticket  to the land of truth  and my suitcase in my hand  how i lost my friends  i still dont understand  they had the best selection  they were poisoned with protection  there was nothing that they needed  nothing left to find  they were lost in rock formations  or became park bench mutations  on the sidewalks and in the stations  they were waiting waiting  so i got bored and left them there  they were just dead weight to me  better down the road  without that load  brings back the time  when i was eight or nine  i was watching my mamas tv  it was that great grand canyon rescue episode  where the vulture glides descending  on an asphalt highway bending  through libraries and museums  galaxies and stars  down the windy halls of friendship  to the rose clipped by the bullwhip  the motel of lost companions  waits with heated pool and bar  but me im not stopping there  got my own row left to hoe  just another line  in the field of time  when the thrashers come  ill be stuck in the sun  like the dinosaurs in shrines  but ill know the time has come  to give whats mine on the roller coaster ride  that

night to go  one more sleep  upon your burning banks  a greedy man never knows  what hes done  a natural beauty should be preserved  like a monument to nature  dont judge yourself too harsh  my love  or someday you might find  your soul endangered  a natural beauty should be preserved  like a monument to nature  went to the rodeo today  i saw the cowgirls  lined up on the fence  a brand new chevrolet  a brand new pair of seamless pants  we watched the moment of defeat  played back over on the video screen  somewhere deep inside  of my soul  a natural beauty should be preserved  like a monument to nature someone and someone were down by the pond  looking for something to plant in the lawn  out in the fields they were turning the soil  im sitting here hoping this water will boil  when i look through the windows and out on the road  theyre bringing me presents and saying hello  singing words words between the lines of age  words words between the lines of age  if i was a junkman selling you cars  washing your windows and shining your stars  thinking your mind was my own in a dream  what would you wonder and how would it seem  living in castles a bit at a time  the

anywhere to stay  the red river stills flows through my home town  rollin and tumblin on its way  swirling around the old bridge pylons  where a boy fishes the morning away  his bicycle leans on an oak tree  while the cars rumble over his head  an aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky  and the young birds call out to be fed  an old man walks along on the sidewalk  sunglasses and an old stetson hat  the four winds blow the back of his overcoat away  as he stops with the policeman to chat  and a train rolls out of the station  that was really something in its day  picking up speed on the straight prairie rails  as it carries the passengers away  its a dream  only a dream  and its fading now  fading away all the sailors with their seasick mamas  hear the sirens on the shore  singing songs for pimps with tailors  who charge ten dollars at the door  you can really learn a lot that way  it will change you in the middle of the day  though your confidence may be shattered  it

a dream  its only reality the way it seems  the happier you fly  the sadder you fall  the laughter in your eyes  is never all  give me strength to move along  give me strength to realize shes gone  im riding down this wet road in my old car  the moon is almost full except for star shine  the party ended long before the night  but she made me feel alive and thats all right  the happier you fly  the sadder you fall  the laughter in your eyes  is never all  give me strength to move along  give me strength to realize shes gone  the happier you fly  the sadder you fall  the laughter in your eyes  is

season  why in crowds just a trace  of my face could seem so pleasing  ill cop out to the change  but a stranger is putting the tease on  i was down on a frown  when the messenger brought me a letter  i was raised by the praise of a fan  who said i upset her  any girl in the world could have easily known me better  she said youre strange but dont change  and i let her  in a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster  stick around while the clown who is sick  does the trick of disaster  for the race of my head and my face  is moving much faster  is it strange i should change  i dont know why dont you ask her  is it strange i should change  i dont  is it strange i should change  i dont the little creatures run in from the cold  back to the nest just like the days of old  there in the

in the morning  with an arrow through my nose  there was an indian in the corner  trying on my clothes  well i used to be asleep you know  with blankets on my bed  i stayed there for a while till they discovered i was dead  the coroner was friendly i liked him quite a lot  if i hadnt have been a woman  i guess id never have been caught  they gave me back my house and car  and nothing more was said  well i was driving down the freeway  when my car ran out of gas  pulled over to the station but i was afraid to ask  the servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green  although i knew i could not  i thought that i was gonna scream  that was on my last trip to tulsa  just before the snow  if you ever need a ride there  be sure to let me know  i was chopping down a palm tree  when a friend dropped by to ask  if i would feel less lonely  if he helped me swing the axe  i said no its not a case of being lonely we have here  ive been working on this palm tree  for eighty seven years  i said no its not a case of being lonely we have here  ive been working on this palm tree  for eighty seven years  he said go get lost and walked toward his cadillac  i chopped down the palm tree  and it landed on his back hey hey  cripple creek ferry  butting through  the overhanging trees  make way  for the cripple creek ferry  the waters going down  its a mighty tight squeeze  all alone the captain stands  hasnt heard  from his deck hands  the gambler tips his hat  and walks towards the door  its the second half  of the cruise  and you know he hates to lose  hey hey  cripple creek ferry  butting through  the overhanging trees  make way  for the cripple creek ferry  the waters going down  its a mighty tight squeeze it has often been my dream  to live with one who wasnt there  like an ocean

to love  got the will to love  ill never lose it  never lose the will to love  never lose the will  its like something from up above  i can be like a fire in the night  always warm and giving off light  but there comes a time when i shine too bright  oh im just a fire in the night  and now my fins are in the air  and my belly is scraping on the rocks  i still think someone really cares  and ill keep swimming til i stop  got the will to love  got the will to love  its like something from up above  never lose the will to love  never lose the will  im like a singer on the stage  with the golden lights and liquid rage  down from the mountains to the sea  cool running love keeps cleansing me  it keeps my gills from getting dry  but it distorts things in my eyes  sometimes i see what really isnt there  like my true lover and i care  but ill never lose  got the will to love  got the will to love  never lose the will to love  its like something from up above  sometimes i ramble on and on  and i repeat myself til all my friends are gone  and get lost in snow and drown in rain  and never feel the same again  i remember the ocean from where i came  just one of millions all the same  but somewhere someone calls my name  im a harpoon dodger and i cant wont be tamed  but ill never lose the will to love  never lose the will to love  got the will to love  got the will to love

ticket and ill take that ride  if we meet along the way please sway beside me  let us sway together our tails together  and our fins and mind will leave this water  and let our scales shine  in the sun above and the sky below  so all the water and earth will know  it has often been my dream  to live with one who wasnt there im climbing this ladder  my head in the clouds  i hope that it matters  im having my doubts  im watching the skaters  fly by on the lake  ice frozen six feet deep  how long does it take  i look out on peaceful lands  with no war nearby  an ocean of shaking hands  that grab at the sky  im singing this borrowed tune  i took from the rolling stones  alone in this empty room  too wasted to write my own  im climbing this ladder  my head in the clouds  i hope that it matters show me that garden in the sun that you saw  let me see the flowers and\\u2005the\\u2005bees before they\\u2005fall  i know that you says theyll\\u2005always be there  i know youre not worried

sometimes you ride away  dont tell no stories  dont tell no lies  not even the ones you already tried  not proud of lies  nothing is saved  just a road to nowhere your name engraved  they pick up on you  as you pick up on them  just cause theyre birds dont mean you cant fly  so dont be sorry  the pastor touched my hand  here on the church steps  i was  or   i had a change of heart  was a change of heart  a change of heart  life is confusing  love is time bent  hate is not worth using  even as cement  to build your walls  that you hide behind  and not see over and it blows your mind  theres hate there now  that never was  love is waiting just because of you cuz  theres nothing sacred  a blind man said  i see your feelings inside my head  i cant predict it what happens next  i love a future i dont expect  you fortune tellers  you take my hand  see whats there  its sifting sands  i had a change of heart  it was a change of heart  just a change of heart  i was the ocean  washed up here  im your emotions  im your fresh beard  so drink me up and laugh away  and lets all continue on another day  maybe tomorrow our ship will come in  and well set the sails for oblivion  not so fast

conversation too  or did you just pass on through  you didnt see me in toronto  when i first tried out some hash  smoked through a pen and id do it again  but i didnt have the cash  i didnt have the cash  then i tried amphetamines  and my head was in a glass  taped underneath the speedometer wires  of my  buicks dash  but i knew that wouldnt last  then came california  where i first saw open water  in the land of opportunity  i knew i was getting hotter  i knew i was getting hotter  but the neon lights  and the endless nights  they took me by surprise  the doctor gave me valium  but i still couldnt close my eyes  i still couldnt close my eyes  then came paranoia  and it ran away with me  i couldnt sign my autograph  or appear on tv  or see or be seen  living in the country  looked good to me  smoking grass while the summer passed  in a real organic scene  where everything was green  then we had a kid and we split apart  i was living on the road  and a little cocaine went a long long way  to ease that different load  and my head did explode  my head did explode  i thought i was an aztec  or a runner in peru  i would build such beautiful buildings  to house the chosen few  like an inca from peru  now many years have come and gone  like friends and enemies  i tried to leave my past behind  but its catching up with me  its catching up with me  i dont know how im standing here  living my life  im thankful for my children  and my faithful wife im going to give you till the morning comes  till the morning comes  till the morning comes  im only waiting till the morning

just want to be queen  and he fights the way he feels  is this the end of a dream  and then he sees her coming  heartbeats on the wind  considers slowing down  but then he could never win  and she out in the distance  sees him against the sky  a pale and violent rider  a dream begun in wine  and she wonders is this real  or does she just want to be queen  and he fights the way he feels  is this the end of a dream  a dream as the thunder wakes her  and her highwayman disappears  on a life already lived before  in eyes welled with tears  today and still today they ride  will they ever win  he the

love that was more than a love  i and my annabel lee  with a love that the winged angels of heaven  they coveted her and me  and the moon never beams  without bringing me dreams  and the sun never shines  but i see the bright eyes  i lie down by the side  the angels not half so happy in heaven  when envying her and me  that was the reason as all men know  in this kingdom by the sea  the wind came out of the cloud that night  killing my my annabel lee  and the moon never beams  without bringing me dreams  and the sun never shines  but i see the bright eyes  i lie down by the side  but our love was stronger by far than the love  of those who were older than we  of many far wiser than we  and neither the angels in heaven above  nor the demons down under the sea  can ever dissever my soul from the soul  of the beautiful annabel lee  and the moon never beams  without bringing me dreams  and the sun never shines  but i see the bright eyes  i lie down by the side  i lie down by the side of my darling  my life my life and my bride  i lie down by her side  i lie down by her side my darling  my life my life and my bride  i lie down by her side  i lie down  by her side  i lie down  by

he was no more than a baby then  well he seemed broken hearted  something within him  but the moment that i first laid  eyes on him all alone  on the edge ofseventeen  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  i went today maybe i will go again tomorrow  and the music there it was hauntingly familiar  and i see you doing what i try to do for me  with the words from a poet and the voice from a choir  and a melody nothing else mattered  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  the clouds never expect it when it rains  but the sea changes colours but the sea  does not change  and so with the slow graceful flow of age  i went forth with an age old desire to please  on the edge ofseventeen  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  well then suddenly there was no one  left standing in the hall  in a flood of tears that  no one really ever heard fall at all  oh i went searchin for an answer  up the stairs and down the hall  not to find an answer just to hear the call  of a nightbird singing come

hope  a song would set them free  and i said  please god show em the way  please god on this day  spirits all given the strength  peace can come if you really want it  i sat at the piano  stared out of the shadows  i sang the words i have a dream  he wasnt my old friend john  i didnt know him then  but he smiled at me  and i sang these words  whatever it takes  whatever it takes to be free  no i didnt know these men  but they knew me  it was all symbolic  nothing was as it seemed  they all left us in a single shot  but they didnt take the dream  they were there in that house  discussing the future  and drinking champagne  i was just a piano player  the voice part of their dream  i was thirtyfive and maybe i was fifteen  it was just another night in the presence of martin luther king  i was just a dreamer  i was ready for the kennedys  and i said  please god show em the way  please god on this day  light the fire start it over  tell the world about the dream  start it up and make it

sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  and the days go by like a strand in the wind  in the web that is my own i begin again  said to my friend baby nothin else mattered  he was no more than a baby then  well he seemed broken hearted  something within him  but the moment that i first laid  eyes on him all alone  on the edge ofseventeen  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  i went today maybe i will go again tomorrow  and the music there it was hauntingly familiar  and i see you doing what i try to do for me  with the words from a poet and the voice from a choir  and a melody nothing else mattered  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  the clouds never expect it when it rains  but the sea changes colours but the sea  does not change  and so with the slow graceful flow of age  i went forth with an age old desire to please  on the edge ofseventeen  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  well then suddenly there was no one  left standing in the hall  in a flood of tears that  no one really ever heard fall at all  oh i went searchin for an answer  up the stairs and down the hall  not to find an answer just to hear the call  of a nightbird singing come away   just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  well i hear you in the morning  and i hear you at nightfall  sometime to be near you  is to be unable to hear you my love  im a few years older than you   my love  just like the white winged dove sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo  just like the white winged sings a song  sounds like shes singing  whoo whoo whoo and when she walked in the room  after so many years  he looked up and saw her  he was standing at the crossroads  she was moving in slow motion  everything was the same  except that everything was different  in that very moment everyone was silent  and everyone was friendly  for the first time in years  everyone was smiling  though their pain was apparent  and the floor was wet and slippery  with the tracks of their tears  and when i see someone standing  at the side of the stage  not standing in the shadows  i see her face  glowing in the darkness  in her own angel way  i have come to make you better  i have come to take you away  no one slipped and fell  this time everyone was steady  someone held my arm so that  i would not fall  for the fist time in a long time  everyone was ready  no one said a word  and that simply said it all  and then i see someone standing  at the side of the stage  not standing in the shadows  i see her face  glowing in the darkness  in her own angel way  i have come to make you better  i have come to take you away  ill make you better  walking through the room together  in suspended animation  no one saw us go no one said goodbye  but in my heart i leave  great expectations  that you will find the answers  to your questions  and that life will once more  be a celebration  and that you will be touched by an angel  and that you will be touched by an angel  and that you will be touched by an angel  celebration  someday  someday someday  celebration she was so enticed  by his smile  she was so unaffected  by his dream  for his dream of her  was just not possible  she was so not that girl  it was just one of those things  that happened or didnt happen  a strand of golden hair tangled  like the words of a song  like a spiders web  and then he said  everybody loves you  but youre so alone  everybody knows your name  but you cant find your way home  no one really knows you  im the only one  she was so enchanted by his voice  she was so shaken by his words  his plan for her  was just not possible  she had no words  ooh it isnt just that  we cause each other such pain  everywhere we go now  at home or on stage  sometimes it was heavenly  sometimes it was too heavy  i looked the other way  everybody loves you  but youre so alone  everybody knows your name  but you cant find your way home  no one really knows you  im the only one  dont come here again  unless fear of fire leaves you cold  and the cold makes you tired  if you feel it all  its all about desire  about when you were true  about a bird on a wire  and that was you  she does still hear him  all night long  the same song over and over  it heals her heart  no voice of a stranger  could play that part  it broke her heart  broke her heart  everybody loves you  but youre so alone  everybody knows your name  but you cant find your way home  everybody loves you  but youre so alone  everybody knows your name  but you cant find your way home  no one really knows you  im the only one whats cheaper than free  you and me  whats better than alone  going home  what does money not buy  you and i  whats not to feel  when love is real  whats faster than a fast car  a beating heart  whats deeper than a deep well  the love into which i fell  more important than freedom  being needed  more exciting than high fashion  high passion  whats brighter than a smile  you child  you child  whats brighter than a smile  you child  you child  you child  you child  whats warmer than a sun drenched land your hand  your hand  your hand',\n",

mother  then all i hear is   and the hands get heavy oh the hands  i dont know what to do with the hands or the feet  frozen in fear like a deer with the lights  in their eyes in the middle of the street  she might be wanting to get touchyfeely  she might be talking to me really nice  she might as well be speaking swahili  cause all i hear is   and my tongue gets big  and i cant move my knees  and my eyeballs freeze  and all i sees a tunnel  and theres cotton in my head  my legs are full of lead  and my brain goes deader than the dead sea  dead dead  dead in the mind and i find that i kind of  go into an infantile trance  im peeing in my  not literally  peeing in my   but you know i may as well be  peeing in my   then i lose my wits  and my lights go off  i get all sticky in the pits  and i smell like falafel  and my ears get hot  and i feel real awful  and all i hear is  dead dead dead  belly up going round  sinking down down down  like a schmuck  dead in the head  dead in the water  dead in a magical sea  full of suck  go ahead and tell me i should keep on trying  go ahead and tell me i should break the ice  ill be standing here deaf and dying  and all ill hear is i still

the hallway  voices calling my name  tell me what you want from me  white noise coming from the tv  nobody believes me that  it felt like the beginning  at least it did to me  and it is what it is  and its just what it will be  shes all that i wanted  shes so unreal to me  and now this house is haunted  shes just makebelieve  maybe it was all a dream cause  thats the way it seems  a flicker in the dark again  i feel like such a lonely creature  dont know how to reach her  dont know how to tell my friends that  im caught up in my delusion  drown in my confusion  they will think im losing it  white noise coming from the tv  nobody believes me that  it felt like the beginning  at least it did to me  and it is what it is  and its just what it will be  shes all that i wanted  shes so unreal to me  and now this house is haunted  shes just makebelieve  youre still here even though youre gone  you disappear when the lights come on  youre still the one that i dream about  now im stuck in a nightmare and i cant get out  hear you say my name  feel you touch my skin  know its all in my head  but i keep giving in  you were the one i always wanted  you were the one that left me haunted  white noise coming from the tv  do you believe me yet  shes all that i wanted  shes so unreal to me  and now this house is haunted  shes just makebelieve clouds so swift rain wont lift  gate wont close railings froze  get your mind off wintertime  you aint goin nowhere  whooee ride me high  tomorrows the day  my brides going to come  oh oh are we going to fly  down in the easy chair  i dont

steep  when we get up to it  whooee ride me high  tomorrows the day  my brides going to come  oh oh are we going to fly  down in the easy chair waiting whats new here  youre waiting im waiting  cause thats what we do here  same as we do every day  for something i dont know to happen  no just something different to happen  just waiting for something to change  just a change  sometimes it feels like were moving in a circle  around and around with the same scenery going by  but no ones complaining  were experts at waiting  oh  ah  times like a river sometimes  times like an ocean  the sofa is my boat  and im just drifting right along  time is like syrup  and im the bug stuck  in the syrup  just kind of trying to find out  what im doing wrong  just waiting for something  to happen for  anything to happen  waiting to find out  what im doing wrong  ah  ah  you know what i think  theres two kinds of waiting  theres the kind where youre expecting something new  or even strange  but this kind of waiting you keep looking off out into the distance  even though you know the view is never going to change  you wait  waiting for something  for anything to happen  just waiting for anything to  wait she was in a white dress  with red and purple ribbons in her hair  she was dancing with somebody  but in love and music all is fair  we were finishing the girl from ipanema  going into summertime  i was in the middle of my solo  when her eyes met mine  love starts on a downbeat  love starts when the music starts  love starts when the tune is sweet  and you lift your feet  to the beat of your heart  love makes a rhythm  love dances in a dancers shoes  it moves when you start to move  and what is the groove  the beat of your heart  and we played moon river  and i want to hold your hand  and the girl in the white dress  and the ribbons in her hair  danced to my band  and i could feel my heart  it started jumping in my chest  and i smiled at her  and she smiled at me  and the music did the rest  love sparks on the upbeat  igniting with a minor   resolving to a major   then something clicks  and everything starts  there goes the kick drum  spelling out the rhythm of love  telling you get off your seat  and move your feet  and dance to the beat of your heart  and if you play me summertime  and if i stop and close my eyes  ill see an angel swirling moving  young and so alive  this music is a time machine  this music is a gift from god  her face was beautiful  my god her face was beautiful  so maybe im romantic  maybe im a sentimental fool  maybe music is the food of love  but music and love who can tell them apart  just let me hear the downbeat  let me hear the downbeat  and let me hear the bah bah bah  bah bah bah  let me hear you kick the kick  and whack the snare  and shake your ass  and stir up the air  and dance with the girl with the ribbons in her hair  embracing the rhythm of love  thats exactly the same as  the beat of your heart  the beat of your heart  the beat of your heart  the beat of your heart i caught your eye across the room  no one can feel the tension between me and\\u2005you  theres\\u2005no need to\\u2005mention all

man who swears hes not to blame  all day long i hear him shouting so loud  just crying out that he was framed  i see my light come shinin  from the west down to the east  any day now any day now  i shall be released its knowing that your door is always open  and your path is free to walk  that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag  rolled up and stashed behind your couch  and its knowing im not shackled  by forgotten words and bonds  and the ink stains that are dried upon some line  that keeps you on the backroads  by the rivers of my memory  that keeps you ever gentle on my mind  its not clinging to the rocks and ivy  planted on their columns now that bind me  or something that somebody said  because they thought we fit together walking  its just knowing that the world will not be cursing  or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find  that youre moving on the backroads  by the rivers of my memory  and for hours youre just gentle on my mind  though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  and the junkyards and the highways come between us  and some other womans cryin to her mother  cause she turned and i was gone  i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  and the summer sun might burn me til im blind  but not to where i cannot see you walkin on the backroads  by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin  cracklin cauldron in some train yard  my beard a roughnin coal pile and  a dirty hat pulled low across my face  through cupped hands round the tin can  i pretend to hold you to my breast and find  that youre waiting from the backroads  by the rivers of my memories  ever smilin ever gentle on my mind  gentle on my mind  you are gentle on my mind it aint complicated  well ive grown to hate

missing ol johnny cash well theres many a strange impulse out on the plains of west texas  theres many a young boy who feels things he cant comprehend  and a small town dont like it when somebody falls between sexes  no a small town dont like it when a cowboy has feelings for men  and i believe to my soul that inside every man theres the feminine  and inside every lady theres a deep manly voice loud and clear  well a cowboy may brag about things that hes done with his women  but the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer  cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other  say what do you think all them saddles and boots was about  and theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother  and inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out  and theres always somebody who says what the others just whisper  and mostly that someones the first one to get shot down dead  so when you talk to a cowboy dont treat him like he was a sister  you cant fuck with a lady thats sleepin in each cowboys head  cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other  what did you think all them saddles and boots was about  and theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother  and inside every lady theres a cowboy who wants to come out  and inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out yes i understand that every life must end uhhuh  as we sit alone i know someday we must go uhhuh  oh im a lucky man to count on both hands the ones i love  some folks just have one yeah others theyve got none uhhuh  stay with me ohh  lets just breathe  practiced on my sins never gonna let you win uhhuh  under everything just another human being uhhuh  i dont want to hurt  theres so much in this world to make me believe  stay with me  youre all i see  did i say that i need you  did i say that i want you  oh if i didnt im a fool you see  no one knows this more than me  but i come clean  i wonder

our love was new  and each kiss an inspiration  but that was long ago  and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song  beside the garden wall when stars are bright  you are in my arms  the nightingale tells his fairy tale  a paradise where roses bloom  though i dream in vain  in my heart there always will remain  my stardust melody  the memory of loves refrain  though i dream in vain  in my heart there always will remain  my stardust melody  the memory of loves refrain  though i dream in vain  in my heart there always will remain  my stardust melody  the memory of loves refrain

asleep on the hillside  and his heart was heavy as night  dont cross him dont boss him  hes wild in his sorrow  hes riding and hiding his pain  dont fight him dont spite him  just wait til tomorrow  maybe hell ride on again  a yellowhaired lady leaned out of her window  and watched as he passed her way  she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion  but cast greedy eyes on the bay  but how could she know that this dancing bay pony  meant more to him than life  for this was the horse that his little lost darling  had ridden when she was his wife  dont cross him dont boss him  hes wild in his sorrow  hes riding and hiding his pain  dont fight him dont spite him  just wait till tomorrow  maybe hell ride on again  the yellowhaired lady came down to the tavern  and looked up the stranger there  he bought her a drink and he gave her some money  he just didnt seem to care  she followed him out as he saddled his stallion  and laughed as she grabbed at the bay  he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her  she never heard anyone say  dont cross him dont boss him  hes wild in his sorrow  hes riding and hiding his pain  dont fight him dont spite him  just wait til tomorrow  maybe hell ride on again  the yellowhaired lady was buried at sunset  the stranger went free of course  for you cant hang a man for killing a woman  whos trying to steal your horse  this is the tale of the red headed stranger  and if he should pass your way  stay out of the path of the raging black stallion  and dont lay a hand on the bay  dont cross him dont boss him  hes wild in his sorrow  hes riding

pale    she said she wanted shore leave  tho in truth we were at sea  so i took her by a looking glass  and forced her to agree  saying you must be the mermaid  who took neptune for a ride  well she

spot  no beginning no end  just a moment in time that you cant have back  you never left but your bags were packed  just in case  my favorite picture of you  is bent and its faded  and its pinned to my wall  oh and you were so angry  that its hard to believe  that we were lovers at all  theres a fire in your eyes your hearts on your sleeve  a curse on your lips but all i can see is beautiful  my favorite picture of you  is the one where  your wings are showing  and your arms are crossed  and your fists are clenched  not gone but going  a standup angel who wont back down  nobodys fool and nobodys clown  you were smarter than that  my favorite picture of you  is the one where  it hasnt rained yet  and as i recall  there came a winter squall  and we got soaking wet  a thousand words in the blink of an eye  the camera loves you and so do i  click  my favorite picture of you  is the one where youre staring  straight into the lens the whole sky opens up  and it rains down on my head  i

with no direction home  a complete unknown  like a rolling stone  aw you never turned around to see the frowns  on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you  never understood that it aint no good  you shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you  you used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat  who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat  aint it hard when you discover that  he really wasnt where its at  after he took from you everything he could steal  how does it feel  how does it feel  to hang on your own  with no direction home  like a complete unknown  like a

the whole world is on your case  i could offer you a warm embrace  to make you feel my love  when the evening shadows and the stars appear  and there is no one there to dry your tears  i could hold you for a million years  to make you feel my love  i know you havent made your mind up yet  but i would never do you wrong  ive known it from the moment that we met  no doubt in my mind where you belong  id go hungry id go black and blue  id go crawling down the avenue  theres nothing that i wouldnt do  to make you feel my love  the storms are raging on the rolling sea  and on the highway of regret  the winds of change are blowing wild and free  you aint seen nothing like me yet  i could make you happy make your dreams come true  nothing that i wouldnt do  go to the ends of the earth for you  to make you feel my love pistol shots ring out in the barroom night  enter patty valentine from the upper hall  she sees the bartender in a pool of blood  cries out my god they killed them all  here comes the story of the hurricane  the man the authorities came to blame  for something that he never done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world  three bodies lyin there  does patty see  and another man named bello  moving around mysteriously  i didnt do it he says  and he throws up his hands  i was only robbin the register  i hope you understand  i saw them leaving he says and he stops  one of us had better call up the cops  and so patty calls the cops  and they arrive on the scene  with their red lights flashin  in the hot new jersey night  meanwhile far away in another part of town  rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around  number one contender for the middleweight crown  had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down  when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road  just like the time before and the time before that  in paterson thats just the way things go  if youre black  you might as well not show up on the street  unless you want to draw the heat  alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops  him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around  he said i saw two men running out  they looked like middleweights  they jumped into a white car with outofstate plates  and miss patty valentine just nodded her head  cop said wait a minute boys this ones not dead  so they took him to the infirmary  and though this man could hardly see  they told him that he could identify the guilty men  four in the morning and they haul rubin in  they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs  the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye  says why did you bring him in here for  he aint the guy  heres the story of the hurricane  the man the authorities came to blame  for something that he never done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world  four months later the ghettos are in flame  rubins in south america fighting for his name  while arthur dexter bradleys still in the robbery game  and the cops are putting the screws to him  lookin for somebody to blame  remember that murder that happened in a bar  remember you said you saw the getaway car  you think youd like to play ball with the law  think it mighta been that fighter that you saw  running that night  dont forget that you are white  arthur dexter bradley said im really not sure  the cops said a poor boy like you could use a break  we got you for the motel job  and were talking to your friend bello  now you dont want to have to go back to jail  be a nice fellow  youll be doing society a favor  that sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver  we want to put his ass in stir  we want to pin this triple murder  on him  he aint no gentleman jim  rubin could take a man out with just one punch  but he never did like to talk about it all that much  its my work hed say and i do it for pay  and when its over id just as soon go on my way  up to some paradise  where the trout streams flow and the air is nice  and ride a horse along a trail  but then they took him to the jailhouse  where they try to turn a man  into a mouse  all of rubins cards were marked in advance  the trial was a pigcircus  he never had a chance  the judge made rubins witnesses  drunkards from the slums  to the white folks who watched  he was a revolutionary bum  and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger  no one doubted that he pulled the trigger  and though they could not produce the gun  the da said he was the one  who did the deed  and the allwhite jury agreed  rubin carter was falsely tried  the crime was murder one  guess who testified  bello and bradley and they both baldly lied  and the newspapers they all went along for the ride  how can the life of such a man  be in the palm of some fools hand  to see him obviously framed  couldnt help but make me feel ashamed  to live in a land  where justice is a game  now all the criminals in their coats and their ties  are free to drink martinis  and watch the sun rise  while rubin sits like buddha  in a tenfoot cell  an innocent man in a living hell  yes thats the story of the hurricane  but it wont be over till they clear his name  and give him back the time hes done  put in a prison cell but one time he coulda been  the champion of the world well it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  ifn you dont know by now  and it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  itll never do somehow  when your rooster crows at the break of dawn  look out your window and ill be gone  youre the reason im atraveling on  but

stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways  ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  oh what did you see my blueeyed son  and what did you see my darling young one  i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  i saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping  i saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding  i saw a white ladder all covered with water  i saw tenthousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  and what did you hear my blueeyed son  and what did you hear my darling young one  i heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning  i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing  i heard tenthousand whispering and nobody listening  i heard one person starve i heard many people laughing  i heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  i heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  oh what did you meet my blueeyed son  and who did you meet my darling young one  i met a young child beside a dead pony  i met a white man who walked a black dog  i met a young woman her body was burning  i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow  i met one man who was wounded in love  i met another man who was wounded in hatred  and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall  and what will you do now my blueeyed son  and what will you do now my darling young one  im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling  ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest  where the people are many and their hands are all empty  where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  and the executioners face is always well hidden  where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten  where black is the color where none is the number  and ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it  and reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it  then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinking  but ill know my song well before i start singing  and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard  its a hard rains agoing to fall come you masters of war  you that build the big guns  you that build the death planes  you that build all the bombs  you that hide behind walls  you that hide behind desks  i just want you to know  i can see through your masks  you that never done nothing  but build to destroy  you play with my world  like its your little toy  you put a gun in my hand  and you hide from my eyes  and you turn and run farther  when the fast bullets fly  like judas of old  you lie and deceive  a world war can be won  you want me to believe  but i see through your eyes  and i see through your brain  like i see through the water  that runs down my drain  you fasten all the triggers  for the others to fire  then you set back and watch  while the death count gets higher  you hide in your mansion  while the young peoples blood  flows out of their bodies  and is buried in the mud  youve thrown the worst fear  that can ever be hurled  fear to bring children  into the world  for threatening my baby  unborn and unnamed  you aint worth the blood  that runs in your veins  how much do i know  to talk out of turn  you might say that im young  you might say im unlearned  but theres one thing i know  though im younger than you  that even jesus would never  forgive what you do  let me ask you one question  is your money that good  will it buy you forgiveness  do you think that it could  i think you will find  when your death takes its toll  all the money you made  will never buy back your soul  and i hope that you die  and your death will

fortunetelling lady  has even taken all her things inside  all except for cain and abel  and the hunchback of notre dame  everybody is making love  or else expecting rain  and the good samaritan hes dressing  hes getting ready for the show  hes going to the carnival tonight  on desolation row  ophelia shes neath the window  for her i feel so afraid  on her twentysecond birthday  she already is an old maid  to her death is quite romantic  she wears an iron vest  her professions her religion  her sin is her lifelessness  and though her eyes are fixed upon  noahs great rainbow  she spends her time peeking  into desolation row  einstein disguised as robin hood  with his memories in a trunk  passed this way an hour ago  with his friend a jealous monk  now he looked so immaculately frightful  as he bummed a cigarette  then he went off sniffing drainpipes  and reciting the alphabet  you would not think to look at him  but he was famous long ago  for playing the electric violin  on desolation row  dr filth he keeps his world  inside of a leather cup  but all his sexless patients  theyre trying to blow it up  now his nurse some local loser  shes in charge of the cyanide hole  and she also keeps the cards that read  have mercy on his soul  they all play on the pennywhistle  you can hear them blow  if you lean your head out far enough  from desolation row  across the street theyve nailed the curtains  theyre getting ready for the feast  the phantom of the opera  in a perfect image of a priest  they are spoon feeding casanova  to get him to feel more assured  then theyll kill him with selfconfidence  after poisoning him with words  and the phantoms shouting to skinny girls  get outta here if you dont know  casanova is just being punished for going  to desolation row  at midnight all the agents  and the superhuman crew  come out and round up everyone  that knows more than they do  then they bring them to the factory  where the heart attack machine  is strapped across their shoulders  and then the kerosene  is brought down from the castles  by insurance men who go  check to see that nobody is escaping  to desolation row  praise be to neros neptune  the titanic sails at dawn  everybodys shouting  which side are you on  and ezra pound and t s eliot  fighting in the captains tower  while calypso singers laugh at them  and fishermen hold flowers  between the windows of the sea  where lovely mermaids flow  and nobody has to think too much  about desolation row  yes i received your letter yesterday  about the time the doorknob broke  when you asked me how i was doing  was that some kinda joke  all these people that you mention  yes i know them theyre quite lame  i had to rearrange their faces  and give them all another name  right now i cant read too good  dont send me no more letters no  not unless you mail them  from desolation row early one morning the sun was shining  i was laying in bed  wondering if shed changed at all  if her hair was still red  her folks they said our lives together  sure was going to be rough  they never did like mamas homemade dress  papas bankbook wasnt big enough  and i was standing on the side of the road  rain falling on my shoes  heading out for the east coast  lord knows ive paid some dues  getting through  tangled up in blue  she was married when we first met  soon to be divorced  i helped her out of a jam i guess  but i used a little too much force  we drove that car as far as we could  abandoned it out west  split up on a dark sad night  both agreeing it was best  she turned around to look at me  as i was walking away  i heard her say over my shoulder  well meet again someday  on the avenue  tangled up in blue  i had a job in the great north woods  working as a cook for a spell  but i never did like it all that much  and one day the ax just fell  so i drifted down to new orleans  where i lucky was to be employed  working for a while on a fishing boat  right outside of delacroix  but all the while i was alone  the past was close behind  i seen a lot of women  but she never escaped my mind  and i just grew  tangled up in blue  she was working in a topless place  and i stopped in for a beer  i just kept looking at the side of her face  in the spotlight so clear  and later on when the crowd thinned out  i was just about to do the same  she was standing there in back of my chair  said to me tell me dont i know your name  i muttered something underneath my breath  she studied the lines on my face  i must admit i felt a little uneasy  when she bent down to tie the laces  of my shoe  tangled up in blue  she lit a burner on the stove  and offered me a pipe  i thought youd never say hello she said  you look like the silent type  then she opened up a book of poems  and handed it to me  written by an italian poet  from the thirteenth century  and every one of them words rang true  and glowed like burning coal  pouring off of every page  like it was written in my soul  from me to you  tangled up in blue  i lived with them on montague street  in a basement down the stairs  there was music in the cafes at night  and revolution in the air  then he started into dealing with slaves  and something inside of him died  she had to sell everything she owned  and froze up inside  and when it finally the bottom fell out  i became withdrawn  the only thing i knew how to do  was to keep on keeping on  like a bird that flew  tangled up in blue  so now im going back again  i got to get to her somehow  all the people we used to know  theyre an illusion to me now  some are mathematicians  some are carpenters wives  dont know how it all got started  i dont know what theyre doing with their lives  but me im still on the road  aheading for another joint  we always did feel the same  we just saw it from a different point  of view  tangled up in blue if youre travelin in the north country fair  where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  remember me to one who lives there  for she once was a true love of mine  if you go when the snowflakes storm  when the rivers freeze and summer ends  please see if she has a coat so warm  to keep her from the howling winds  please see if her hair hangs long  if it rolls and flows all down her breast  please see for me if her hairs hangin long  for thats the way i remember her best  im awondering if she remembers me at all  many times ive often prayed  in the darkness of my night  in the brightness of my day  so if youre travelin the north country fair  where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  remember me to one who lives there  for she once was a true love of mine the pale moon rose in its glory  out oer the western town  she told a sad sad story  of the great ship that went down  twas the fourteenth day of april  over the waves she rode  sailing into tomorrow  to a gilded age foretold  the night was black with starlight  the seas were sharp and clear  moving through the shadows  the promised hour was near  lights were holding steady  gliding over the foam  all the lords and ladies  heading for their eternal home  the chandeliers were swaying  from the balustrades above  the orchestra was playing  songs of faded love  the watchman he lay dreaming  as the ballroom dancers twirled  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  into the underworld  leo took his sketchbook  he was often so inclined  he closed his eyes and painted  the scenery in his mind  cupid struck his bosom  and broke it with a snap  the closest woman to him  he fell into her lap  he heard a loud commotion  something sounded wrong  his inner spirit was saying  that he couldnt stand here long  he staggered to the quarterdeck  no time now to sleep  water on the quarterdeck  already three foot deep  smokestack was leaning sideways  heavy feet began to pound  he walked into the whirlwind  sky splitting all around  the ship was going under  the universe had opened wide  the roll was called up yonder  the angels turned aside  lights down in the hallway  flickering dim and dull  dead bodies already floating  in the double bottom hull  the engines then exploded  propellers they failed to start  the boilers overloaded  the ships bow split apart  passengers were flying  backward forward far and fast  they mumbled fumbled and tumbled  each one more weary than the last  the veil was torn asunder  tween the hours of twelve and one  no change no sudden wonder  could undo what had been done  the watchman lay there dreaming  at fortyfive degrees  he dreamed that the titanic was sinking  dropping to her knees  wellington he was sleeping  his bed began to slide  his valiant heart was beating  he pushed the tables aside  glass of shattered crystal  lay scattered roundabout  he strapped on both his pistols  how long could he hold out  his men and his companions  were nowhere to be seen  in silence there he waited for  time and space to intervene  the passageway was narrow  there was blackness in the air  he saw every kind of sorrow  heard voices everywhere  alarmbells were ringing  to hold back the swelling tide  friends and lovers clinging  to each other side by side  mothers and their daughters  descending down the stairs  jumped into the icy waters  love and pity sent their prayers  the rich man mister astor  kissed his darling wife  he had no way of knowing  be the last trip of his life  calvin blake and wilson  gambled in the dark  not one of them would ever live to  tell the tale or disembark  brother rose up gainst brother  in every circumstance  they fought and slaughtered each other  in a deadly dance  they lowered down the lifeboats  from the sinking wreck  there were traitors there were turncoats  broken backs and broken necks  the bishop left his cabin  to help all those in need  turned his eyes up to the heavens  said the poor are yours to feed  davey the brothelkeeper  came out dismissed his girls  saw the water getting deeper  saw the changing of his world  jim backus smiled  he never learned to swim  saw the little crippled child  and he gave his seat to him  he saw the starlight shining  streaming from the east  death was on the rampage  but his heart was now at peace  they battened down the hatches  but the hatches wouldnt hold  they drowned upon the staircase  of brass and polished gold  leo said to cleo  i think im going mad  but hed lost his mind already  whatever mind he had  he tried to block the doorway  to save all those from harm  blood from an open wound  pouring down his arm  petals fell from flowers  tell all of them were gone  in the long and dreadful hours  the wizards curse played on  the host was pouring brandy  he was going down slow  he stayed right to the end and he  was the last to go  there were many many others  nameless here forever more  they never sailed the ocean  or left their homes before  the watchman he lay dreaming  the damage had been done  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  and he tried to tell someone  the captain barely breathing  kneeling at the wheel  above him and beneath him  fifty thousand tons of steel  he looked over at his compass  and he gazed into its face  needle pointing downward  he knew he lost the race  in the dark illumination  he remembered bygone years  he read the book of revelation  and he filled his cup with tears  when the reapers task had ended  sixteen hundred had gone to rest  the good the bad the rich the poor  the loveliest and the best  they waited at the landing  and they tried to understand  but there is no understanding  for the judgment of gods hand  the news came over the wires  and struck with deadly force  the love had lost its fires  all things had run their course  the watchman he lay dreaming  of all the things that can be  he dreamed the titanic was sinking  into the deep blue sea darkness at the break of noon  shadows even the silver spoon  the handmade blade the childs balloon  eclipses both the sun and moon  to understand you know too soon  there is no sense in trying  pointed threats they bluff with scorn  suicide remarks are torn  from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn  plays wasted words proves to warn  that he not busy being born  is busy dying  temptations page flies out the door  you follow find yourself at war  watch waterfalls of pity roar  you feel to moan but unlike before  you discover that youd just be one more  person crying  so dont fear if you hear  a foreign sound to your ear  its alright ma im only sighing  as some warn victory some downfall  private reasons great or small  can be seen in the eyes of those that call  to make all that should be killed to crawl  while others say dont hate nothing at all  except hatred  disillusioned words like bullets bark  as human gods aim for their mark  make everything from toy guns that spark  to fleshcolored christs that glow in the dark  its easy to see without lookin too far  that not much is really sacred  while preachers preach of evil fates  teachers teach that knowledge waits  can lead to hundreddollar plates  goodness hides behind its gates  but even the president of the united states  sometimes must have to stand naked  and though the rules of the road have been lodged  its only peoples games that you got to dodge  and its alright ma i can make it  advertising signs that con  you into thinking youre the one  that can do whats never been done  that can win whats never been won  meantime life outside goes on  all around you  you lose yourself you reappear  you suddenly find you got nothing to fear  alone you stand with nobody near  when a trembling distant voice unclear  startles your sleeping ears to hear  that somebody thinks they really found you  a question in your nerves is lit  yet you know there is no answer fit  to satisfy ensure you not to quit  to keep it in your mind and not forget  that it is not he or she or them or it  that you belong to  but though the masters make the rules  for the wise men and the fools  i got nothing ma to live up to  for them that must obey authority  that they do not respect in any degree  who despise their jobs their destiny  speak jealously of them that are free  do what they do just to be  nothing more than something they invest in  while some on principles baptized  to strict party platform ties  social clubs in drag disguise  outsiders they can freely criticize  tell nothing except who to idolize  and say god bless him  while one who sings with his tongue on fire  gargles in the rat race choir  bent out of shape from societys pliers  cares not to come up any higher  but rather get you down in the hole  that hes in  but i mean no harm nor put fault  on anyone that lives in a vault  but its alright ma if i cant please him  old lady judges watch people in pairs  limited in sex they dare  to push fake morals insult and stare  while money doesnt talk it swears  obscenity who really cares  propaganda all is phony  while them that defend what they cannot see  with a killers pride security  it blows the minds most bitterly  for them that think deaths honesty  wont fall upon em naturally  life sometimes must get lonely  my eyes collide headon with stuffed  graveyards false goals i scuff  at pettiness which plays so rough  walk upside down inside handcuffs  kick my legs to crash it off  say okay ive had enough  what else can you show me  and if my thoughtdreams could be seen  theyd probably put my head in a guillotine  but its alright ma its life and life only today and tomorrow and yesterday too  the flowers are dyin like all things do  follow me close\\u2005im\\u2005going to ballynalee  ill\\u2005lose my mind if you dont\\u2005come with me  i fuss with my hair and i fight blood feuds  i contain multitudes  got a telltale heart like mr poe  got skeletons in the walls of people you know  ill drink to the truth and the things we said  ill drink to the man that shares your bed  i paint landscapes and i paint nudes  i contain multitudes  a red cadillac and a black mustache  rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash  tell me whats next what shall we do  half my soul baby belongs to you  i rollick and i frolic with all the young dudes  i contain multitudes  im just like anne frank like indiana jones  and them british bad boys the rolling stones  i go right to the edge i go right to the end  i go right where all things lost are made good again  i sing the songs of experience like william blake  i have no apologies to make  everythings flowing all at the same time  i live on a boulevard of crime  i drive fast cars and i eat fast foods  i contain multitudes  pink pedalpushers red blue jeans  all the pretty maids and all the old queens  all the old queens from all my past lives  i carry four pistols and two large knives  im a man of contradictions im a man of many moods  i contain multitudes  you greedy old wolf ill show you my heart  but not all of it only the hateful parts  ill sell you down the river ill put a price on your head  what more can i tell you i sleep with life and death in the same bed  get lost madame get up off my knee  keep your mouth away from me  ill keep the path open the path in my mind  ill see to it that theres no love left behind  ill play beethovens sonatas chopins preludes  i contain multitudes you must leave now  take what you need you think

baby blue  the highway is for gamblers better use your sense  take what you have gathered from coincidence  the empty handed painter from your streets  is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  the sky too is folding under you  and its all over now baby blue  all your seasick sailors they are rowing home  all your reindeer armies are all going home  your lover who just walked out the door  has taken all his blankets from the floor  the carpet too is moving under you  and its all over now baby blue  leave your stepping stones behind  theres something that calls for you  forget the dead youve left  they will not follow you  the vagabond whos rapping at your door  is standing in the clothes that you once wore  strike another match go start anew  and its all over now baby blue a tear goes

after all these years  you didnt know me any better than that  sweet lady  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your mouth  blowing down the backroads heading south  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  i ran into the fortuneteller  who said beware of lightning that might strike  i havent known peace and quiet  for so long i cant remember what its like  theres a lone soldier on the cross  smoke pouring out of a boxcar door  you didnt know it you didnt think it could be done  in the final end he won the war  after losing every battle  i woke up on the roadside  daydreaming about the way things sometimes are  visions of your chestnut mare  shoot through my head and are making me see stars  you hurt the ones that i love best  and cover up the truth with lies  one day youll be in the ditch  flies buzzing around your eyes  blood on your saddle  idiot wind  blowing through the flowers on your tomb  blowing through the curtains in your room  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  it was gravity which pulled us down  and destiny which broke us apart  you tamed the lion in my cage  but it just wasnt enough to change my heart  now everythings a little upside down  as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped  whats good is bad whats bad is good  youll find out when you reach the top  youre on the bottom  i noticed at the ceremony  your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  i cant remember your face anymore  your mouth has changed your eyes dont look into mine  the priest wore black on the seventh day  and sat stonefaced while the building burned  i waited for you on the running boards  near the cypress trees while the springtime turned  slowly into autumn  idiot wind  blowing like a circle around my skull  from the grand coulee dam to the capitol  idiot wind  blowing every time you move your teeth  youre an idiot babe  its a wonder that you still know how to breathe  i cant feel you anymore  i cant even touch the books youve read  every time i crawl past your door  i been wishing ive been somebody else instead  down the highway down the tracks  down the road to ecstasy  i followed you beneath the stars  hounded by your memory  and all your raging glory  i been doublecrossed now  for the very last time and now im finally free  i kissed goodbye the howling beast  on the borderline which separated you from me  youll never know the hurt i suffered  nor the pain i rise above  and ill never know the same about you  your holiness or your kind of love  and it makes me feel so sorry  idiot wind  blowing through the buttons of our coats  blowing through the letters that we wrote  idiot wind  blowing through the dust upon our shelves  were idiots babe  its a wonder we can even feed ourselves twas in another lifetime  one of toil and blood  when blackness was a virtue  the road was full of mud  i came in from the wilderness  a creature void of form  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  and if i pass this way again  you can rest assured  ill always do my best for her  on that i give my word  in a world of steeleyed death and men  who are fighting to be warm  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  not a word was spoke between us  there was little risk involved  everything up to that point  had been left unresolved  try imagining a place  where its always safe and warm  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  i was burned out from exhaustion  buried in the hail  poisoned in the bushes  and blown out on the trail  hunted like a crocodile  ravaged in the corn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  suddenly i turned around  and she was standing there  with silver bracelets on her wrists  and flowers in her hair  she walked up to me so gracefully  and took my crown of thorns  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  now theres a wall between us  something theres been lost  i took too much for granted  i got my signals crossed  just to think that it all began  on an uneventful morn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  well the deputy walks on hard nails  and the preacher rides a mount  but nothing really matters much  its doom alone that counts  and the oneeyed undertaker  he blows a futile horn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  ive heard newborn babies wailing  like a mourning dove  and old men with broken teeth  stranded without love  do i understand your question then  is it hopeless and forlorn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  in a little hilltop village  they gambled for my clothes  i bargained for salvation  and she gave me a lethal dose  i offered up my innocence  and i got repaid with scorn  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm  well im living in a foreign country  but im bound to cross the line  beauty walks a razors edge  someday ill make it mine  if i could only turn back the clock  to when god and her were born  come in she said ill give ya  shelter from the storm

lights flicker from the opposite loft  in this room the heat pipes just cough  the country music station plays soft  but theres nothing really nothing to turn off  just louise and her lover so entwined  and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind  in the empty lot where the ladies play blindmans bluff with the key chain  and the allnight girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train  we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight  ask himself if its him or them thats really insane  louise shes all right shes just near  shes delicate and seems like the mirror  but she just makes it all too concise and too clear  that johannas not here  the ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face  where these visions of johanna have now taken my place  now little boy lost he takes himself so seriously  he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously  and when bringing her name up  he speaks of a farewell kiss to me  hes sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all  muttering small talk at the wall while im in the hall  how can i explain  its so hard to get on  and these visions of johanna they kept me up past the dawn  inside the museums infinity goes up on

so cruel  the peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him  sayin name me someone thats not a parasite and ill go out and say a prayer for him  but like louise always says  ya cant look at much can ya man  as she herself prepares for him  and madonna she still has not showed  we see this empty cage now corrode  where her cape of the stage once had flowed  the fiddler he now steps to the road  he writes evrythings been returned which was owed  on the back of the fish truck that loads  while my conscience explodes  the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain  and these visions of johanna are now all that remain oh god said to abraham kill me a son  abe said man you must be puttin me on  god say no  abe say what  god say you can do what you want abe but  the

ago a crazy dream came to me  i dreamt i was walking to world war three  i went to the doctor the very next day  to see what kind of words he could say  he said it was a bad dream  i wouldnt worry about it none though  them old dreams are only in your head  i said hold it doc a world war passed through my brain  he said nurse get your pad the boys insane  he grabbed my arm i said ouch  as i landed on the psychiatric couch  he said tell me about it  well the whole thing started at  oclock fast  it was all over by a quarter past  i was down in the sewer with some little lover  when i peeked out from a manhole cover  wondering who turned the lights on us  well i got up and i walked around  up and down the lonesome town  i stood awondering which way to go  i lit a cigarette on a parking meter  and walked on down the road  it was a normal day  well i rung the fallout shelter bell  and i leaned my head and i give a yell  give me a string bean im a hungry man  a shotgun fired and away i ran  i dont blame him too much though he didnt know me  down at the corner by the hotdog stand  i seen a man  i said howdy friend i guess theres just us two  he screamed a bit and away he flew  thought i was a communist  well i spied me a girl and before she could leave  i said lets go and play adam and eve  i took her by the hand and my heart was thumping  when she said hey man you crazy or something  you seen what happened last time they started  well i seen me a cadillac window uptown  there was nobody around  i got into the drivers seat  and i drove down  street  in my cadillac  good car to drive after a war  well i remember seeing some ad  so i turned on my conelrad  but i didnt pay the con ed bill  so the radio didnt work so well  turned on my record player —  it was rockaday johnny singing tell your ma tell your pa  our loves agoing to grow oohwah oohwah  i was feeling kind of lonesome and blue  i needed somebody to talk to  so i called up the operator of time  just to hear a voice of some kind  when you hear the beep it will be three oclock  she said that for over an hour  and i hung up  well the doctor interrupted me just about then  saying hey ive been having the same old dreams  but mine was a little different you see  i dreamt the only person left after the war was me  i didnt see you around  well now time passed and now it seems  everybodys having them dreams  everybody sees their self  walking around with no one else  half of the people can be part right all of the time  and some of the people can be all right part of the time  but all of the people cant be all right all of the time  i think abraham lincoln said that  ill let you be in my dream if i can be in yours  i said that mother of muses sing for me  sing of the mountains and

light and im aslow coming home they sat together in the park  as the evening sky grew dark  she looked at him and he felt a spark  tingle to his bones  twas then he felt alone  and wished that hed gone straight  and watched out for a simple twist of fate  they walked alone by the old canal  a little confused i remember well  and stopped into a strange hotel  with a neon burning bright  he felt the heat of the night  hit him like a freight train  moving with a simple twist of fate  a saxophone someplace faroff played  as she was walking on by the arcade  as the light bust through a beatup shade  where he was wakin up  she dropped a coin into the cup  of a blind man at the gate  and forgot about a simple twist of fate  he woke up the room was bare  he didnt see her anywhere  he told himself he didnt care  pushed the window open wide  felt an emptiness inside  to which he just could not relate  brought on by a simple twist of fate  he hears the ticking of the clocks  and walks along with a parrot that talks  hunts her down by the waterfront docks  where the sailors all come in  maybe shell pick him out again  how long must he wait  one more time for a simple twist of fate  people tell me its a sin  to know and feel too much within  i still believe she was my twin  but i lost the ring  she was born in spring  but i was born too late  blame it on a simple twist of fate my love she speaks like silence  without ideals or violence  she doesnt have to say shes faithful  yet shes true like ice like fire  people carry roses  and make promises by the hours  my love she laughs like the flowers  valentines cant buy her  in the dime stores and bus stations  people talk of situations  read books repeat quotations  draw conclusions on the wall  some speak of the future  my love she speaks softly  she knows theres no success like failure  and that failures no success at all  the cloak and dagger dangles  madams light the candles  in ceremonies of the horsemen  even a pawn must hold a grudge  statues made of match sticks  crumble into one another  my love winks she does not bother  she knows too much to argue or to judge  the bridge at midnight trembles  the country doctor rambles  bankers nieces seek perfection  expecting all the gifts that wise men bring  the wind howls like a hammer  the night blows rainy  my love shes like some raven  at my window with a broken wing i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more  no i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more  well i wake up in the morning  fold my hands and pray for rain  i got a head full of ideas  that

the russians  all through my whole life  if another war comes  its them we must fight  to hate them and fear them  to run and to hide  and accept it all bravely  with god on my side  but now we got weapons  of chemical dust  if fire them were forced to  then fire them we must  one push of the button  and a shot the world wide  and ya never ask questions  when gods on your side  through many dark

goddess\\u205fof\\u205fthe\\u205fdawn  ive painted my\\u205fwagon abandoned all\\u205fhope  and i crossed the rubicon  well the rubicon is a red river  goin gently as she flows  redder than your ruby lips  and the blood that flows from the rose  three miles north of purgatory  one step from the great beyond  i prayed to the cross i kissed the girls  and i crossed the rubicon  what are these dark days i see  in this world so badly bent  i cannot redeem the time  the time so idly spent  how much longer can it last  how long can it go on  i embrace my love put down my hair  and i crossed the rubicon  i can feel the bones beneath my skin  and theyre tremblin with rage  ill make your wife a widow  youll never see old age  show me one good man in sight  that the sun shines down upon  i pawned my watch i paid my debts  and i crossed the rubicon  put my hide up on a hill  where some happiness ill find  if i survive then let me love  let the hour be mine  take the high road take the low  take any one youre on  i poured the cup i passed it along  and i crossed the rubicon  well you defiled the most lovely flowers  in all her womanhood  others can be tolerant  others can be good  ill cut you up with a crooked knife  lord and ill miss you when youre gone  i stood between heaven and earth  and i crossed the rubicon  you wont find any happiness here  no happiness or joy  go back to the gutter try your luck  find you some nice pretty boy  tell me how many men i need  and who can i count upon  i strapped my belt i buttoned my coat  and i crossed the rubicon  i feel the holy spirit inside  see the light that freedom gives  i believe its in the reach of  every man who lives  keep as far away as possible  its darkest fore the dawn   i turned the key i broke it off  and i crossed the rubicon  mona baby are you still in my mind  i truly believe that you are  couldnt be anybody else but you  whos come with me this far  the killing frost is on the ground  and the autumn leaves are gone  i lit the torch i looked to the east  and i crossed the rubicon if you see her say hello she might be in tangier  she left here last early spring is livin there i hear  say for me that im all right though things get kind of slow  she might think that ive forgotten her dont tell her it isnt so  we had a falling out like lovers often will  and to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill  and though our separation it pierced me to the heart  she still lives inside of me weve never been apart  if you get close to her kiss her once for me  always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin free  oh whatever makes her happy i wont stand in the way  though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night i tried to make her stay  i see a lot of people as i make the rounds  and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town  and ive never gotten used to it ive just learned to turn it off  either im too sensitive or else im gettin soft  sundown yellow moon i replay the past  i know every scene by heart they all went by so fast  if shes passin back this way im not that hard to find  tell her she can look me up if shes got the

boss he lay back flat on his bed  he cursed the heat and he clutched his head  he pondered the future of his fate  to wait another day would be far too late  go fetch me my coat and my tie  and the cheapest labour that money can buy  saddle me up my buckskin mare  if you see me go by put up a prayer   well they rode all night and they rode all day  eastward long down the broad highway  his spirit was tired and his vision was bent  his men deserted him and onward he went  he came to a place where the light was dull  his forehead pounding in his skull  heavy heart was racked with pain  insomnia raging in his brain  well he threw down his helmet and his crosshandled sword  he renounced his faith he denied his lord  crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall  one way or another put an end to it all  he leaned down cut the electric wire  stared into the flames and he snorted the fire  peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two  it was hard to tell for certain who was who  he lowered himself down on a golden chain  his nerves were quaking in every vein  his knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air  he ran his fingers through his greasy hair  they looked at each other and their glasses clinked  one single unit inseparably linked  got a strange premonition theres a man close by   dont worry about him he wouldnt harm a fly   from behind the curtain the boss he crossed the floor  he moved his feet and he bolted the door  shadows hiding the lines in his face  with all the nobility of an ancient race  she turned she was startled with a look of surprise  with a hatred that could hit the skies  youre a reckless fool i could see it in your eyes  to come this way was by no means wise   get up stand up you greedylipped wench  and cover your face or suffer the

you sir you can not deny  you made a monkey of me what and for why   ill have no more of this insulting chat  the devil can have you ill see to that  look sharp or step aside  or in the cradle youll wish youd died   the gun went boom and the shot rang clear  first bullet grazed his ear  second ball went right straight in  and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin  he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head  he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed  it would take more than needle and thread  bleeding from the mouth hes as good as dead  you shot my husband down you fiend   husband what husband what the hell do you mean  he was a man of strife a man of sin  i cut him down and threw him to the wind   this she said with angry breath  you too shall meet the lord of death  it was i who brought your soul to life   then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife  his face was hard and caked with sweat  his arms ached and his hands were wet  youre a murderous queen and a bloody wife  if you dont mind ill have the knife   were two of a kind and our blood runs hot  but were no way similar in body or thought  all husbands are good men as all wives know   then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow  his knees went limp and he reached for the door  his tomb was sealed he slid to the floor  he whispered in her ear this is all your fault  my fighting days have come to a halt   she touched his lips and kissed his cheek  he tried to speak but his breath was weak  you died for me now ill die for you   she put the blade to her heart and she ran it through  all three

even care  its not dark yet  but its getting there  well ive been to london  and ive been to gay paris  ive followed the river  and i got to the sea  ive been down on the bottom  of a world full of lies  i aint looking for nothing  in anyones eyes  sometimes my burden  is more than i can bear  its not dark yet  but its getting there  i was born here and ill die here  against my will  i know it looks like im moving  but im standing still  every nerve in my body  is so vacant and numb  i cant even remember what it was  i came here to get away from  dont even hear a murmur of a prayer  its not dark yet  but its getting there our conversation was short and sweet  it nearly swept me offa my feet  and im back in the rain oh oh  and you are on dry land  you made it there somehow  youre a big girl now  bird on the horizon sitting on a fence  hes singing his song for me at his own expense  and im just like that bird oh oh  singing just for you  i hope that you can hear  hear me singing through these tears  time is a jet plane it moves too fast  oh but what a shame that all weve shared cant last  i can change i swear oh oh  see what you can do  i can make it through  you can make it too  love is so simple to quote a phrase  youve known it all the time im learning it these days  oh i know where i can find you oh oh  in somebodys room  its a price i have to pay  youre a big girl all the way  a change in the weather is known to be extreme  but whats the sense of changing horses in midstream  im going out of my mind oh oh  with a pain that stops and starts  like a corkscrew to my heart  ever since weve been apart i was riding on the mayflower  when i thought i spied some land  i yelled for captain arab  i have you understand  who came running to the deck  said boys forget the whale  look on over yonder  cut the engines  change the sail  haul on the bowline  we sang that melody  like all tough sailors do  when theyre far away at sea  i think ill call it america  i said as we hit land  i took a deep breath  i fell down i could not stand  captain arab he started  writing up some deeds  he said lets set up a fort  and start buyin a place with beads  just then this cop comes down the street  crazy as a loon  he throws us all in jail  for carrying harpoons  ah me i busted out  dont even ask me how  i went to get some help  i walked by a guernsey cow  who directed me down  to the bowery slums  where people carried signs around  sayin ban the bums  i jumped right into line  sayin i hope that im not late  when i realized i hadnt eaten  for five days straight  i went into a restaurant  looking for the cook  i told him i was the editor  of a famous etiquette book  the waitress he was handsome  he wore a powder blue cape  i ordered some suzette i said  could you please make that crepe  just then the whole kitchen exploded  from boilin fat  food was flyin everywhere  i left without my hat  now i didnt mean to be nosy  but i went into a bank  to get some bail for arab  and all the boys back in the tank  they asked me for some collateral  and i pulled down my pants  they threw me in the alley  when up comes this girl from france  who invited me to her house  i went but she had a friend  who knocked me out  and robbed my boots  and i was on the street again  well i rapped upon a house  with the us flag upon display  i said could you help me out  i got some friends down the way  the man says get out of here  ill tear you limb from limb  i said you know they refused jesus too  he said youre not him  get out of here before i break your bones  i aint your pop  i decided to have him arrested  and i went lookin for a cop  i ran right outside  i hopped inside a cab  i went out the other door  this englishman said fab  as he saw me leap a hot dog stand  and a chariot that stood  parked across from a building  advertising brotherhood  i ran right through the front door  like a hobo sailor does  but it was just a funeral parlor  and the man asked me who i was  i repeated that my friends  were all in jail with a sigh  he gave me his card  he said call me if they die  i shook his hand and said goodbye  ran out to the street  when a bowling ball came down the road  and knocked me off my feet  a pay phone was ringing  and it just about blew my mind  when i picked it up and said hello  this foot came through the line  well by this time is fed up  at tryin to make a stab  at bringing back any help  for my friends and captain arab  i decided to flip a coin  like either heads or tails  would let me know if i should go  back to ship or back to jail  so i hocked my sailor suit  and i got a coin to flip  it came up tails  it rhymed with sails  so i made it back to the ship  well i got back and took  the parking ticket off the mast  i was ripping it to shreds  when this coastguard boat went past  they asked me my name  and i said captain kidd  they believed me but  they wanted to know  what exactly that i did  i said for the pope of eruke  i was employed  they let me go right away  they were very paranoid  well the last i heard of arab  he was stuck on a whale  that was married to the deputy  sheriff of the jail  but the funniest thing was  when i was leavin the bay  i saw three ships sailin  there were all heading my way  i asked the captain what his name was  and how come he didnt drive a truck  he said his name was columbus  i just said good luck while riding on a train going west  i fell asleep for to take my rest  i dreamed a dream that made me sad  concerning myself and the first few friends i had  with halfdamp eyes i stared to the room  where my friends and i spent many an afternoon  where we together weathered many a storm  laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn  by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung  our words was told our songs was sung  where we longed for nothing and were satisfied  jokin and talkin about the world outside  with hungry hearts through the heat and cold  we never much thought we could get very old  we thought we could sit forever in fun  and our chances really was a million to one  as easy it was to tell black from white  it was all that easy to tell wrong from right  and our choices they was few so the thought never hit  that the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split  how many a year has passed and gone  many a gamble has been lost and won  and many a road taken by many a first friend  and each one ive never seen again  i wish i wish i wish in vain  that we could sit simply in that room again  ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat  and id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that im searching for phrases  to sing your praises  i need to tell someone  its soon after midnight  and my day has just begun  a gal named honey  took my money  she was passing by  its soon after midnight  and the moon is in my eye  my heart is cheerful  its never fearful  ive been down on the killing floors  im in no great hurry  im not afraid of your fury  ive faced stronger walls than yours  charlottes a harlot  dresses in scarlet  mary dresses in green  its soon after midnight  and ive got a date with the fairy queen  they chirp and they chatter  what does it matter  theyre lying there dying in their blood  twotiming slim  whos ever heard of him  ill drag his corpse through the mud  its now or never  more than ever  when i met you i didnt think you would do  its soon after midnight  and i dont want nobody but you a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers blood  a finger fired the trigger to his name  a handle hid out in the dark  a hand set the spark  two eyes took the aim  behind a mans brain  but he cant be blamed  hes only a pawn in their game  a south politician preaches to the poor white man  you got more than the blacks dont complain  youre better than them you been born with white skin they explain  and the negros name  is used it is plain  for the politicians gain  as he rises to fame  and the poor white remains  on the caboose of the train  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  the deputy sheriffs the soldiers the governors get paid  and the marshals and cops get the same  but the poor white mans used in the hands of them all like a tool  hes taught in his school  from the start by the rule  that the laws are with him  to protect his white skin  to keep up his hate  so he never thinks straight  bout the shape that hes in  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  from the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks  and the hoof beats pound in his brain  and hes taught how to walk in a pack  shoot in the back with his fist in a clinch  to hang and to lynch  to hide neath the hood  to kill with no pain  like a dog on a chain  he aint agot no name  but it aint him to blame  hes only a pawn in their game  today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught  they lowered him down as a king  but when the shadowy sun sets on the one  that fired the gun  hell see by his grave  on the stone that remains  carved next to his name  his epitaph plain  only a pawn in their game if youre travelin to

you cant come back all the way  only one thing i did wrong  stayed in mississippi a day too long the festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall  the cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall  the curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down  anyone with any sense had already left town  he was standing in the doorway looking like the jack of hearts  he moved across the mirrored room set it up for everyone he said  then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads  then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin  could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins  then he moved into the corner face down like the jack of hearts  backstage the girls were playing fivecard stud by the stairs  lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair  outside the streets were filling up the window was open wide  a gentle breeze was blowing you could feel it from inside  lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts  big jim was no ones fool he owned the towns only diamond mine  he made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine  with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place  he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste  but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts  rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town  she slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown  she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear  sorry darling that im late but he didnt seem to hear  he was staring into space over at the jack of hearts  i know ive seen that face somewhere big jim was thinking to himself  maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf  but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim  and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him  staring at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts  lily was a princess she was fairskinned and precious as a child  she did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled  she had come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs  with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere  but shed never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts  the hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined  the drilling in the wall kept

face until breaking my eyes  an said what else you got left  yeah it was then that i got up to leave  but she said dont forget  everybody must give something back  for something they get  i stood there and hummed  i tapped on her drum i asked her how come  and she buttoned her boot  and straightened her suit  then she said dont get cute  so i forced my hands in my pockets  and felt with my thumbs  and gallantly handed her  my very last piece of gum  she threw me outside  i stood in the dirt where everyone walked  and after finding out id  forgotten my shirt  i went back and knocked  i waited in the hallway she went to get it  and i tried to make sense  out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  that leaned up against  her jamaican rum  and when she did come i asked her for some  she said no dear  i said your words arent clear  youd better spit out your gum  she screamed til her face got so red  then she fell on the floor  and i covered her up and then  thought id go look through her drawer  and when i was through  i filled up my shoe  and brought it to you  and you you took me in  you loved me then  you never wasted time  and i i never took much  i never asked for

two trains running side by side forty miles wide  down the eastern line  you dont have to go  i just came to you because youre a friend of mine  i think that when my back was turned  the whole world behind me burned  its been a while  since we walked down that long long aisle  we cried on a cold and frosty morn  we cried because our souls were torn  so much for tears  so much for these long and wasted years sixteen years  sixteen banners united over the fields  where the good shepherd grieves  desperate men desperate women divided  spreading their wings neath falling leaves  fortune calls  i stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace  merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down  shes smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born  on midsummers eve near the tower  the coldblooded moon  the captain waits above the celebration  sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  whose ebony face is beyond communication  the captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid  they shaved her head  she was torn between jupiter and apollo  a messenger arrived with a black nightingale  i seen her on the stairs and i couldnt help but follow  follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil  i stumbled to my feet  i rode past destruction in the ditches  with the stitches still mending neath a heartshaped tattoo  renegade priests and treacherous young witches  were handing out the flowers that id given to you  the palace of mirrors  where dog soldiers are reflected  the endless road and the wailing of chimes  the empty rooms where her memory is protected  where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times  she wakes him up  fortyeight hours later the sun is breaking  near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks  shes begging to know what measures he now will be taking  hes pulling her down and shes clutching onto his long golden locks  gentlemen he said i dont need your organization ive shined your shoes  ive moved your mountains and marked your cards  but eden is burning either get ready for elimination  or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards  peace will come  with tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire  but will offer no reward when her false idols fall  and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  between the king and the queen of swords i married isis on the fifth day of may  but i could not hold on to her very long  so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away  for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong  i came to a high place of darkness and light  dividing line ran through the center of town  i hitched up my pony to a post on the right  went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down  a man in the corner approached me for a match  i knew right away he was not ordinary  he said are you looking for something easy to catch  said i got no money  he said that aint necessary  we set out that night for the cold in the north  i gave him my blanket and he gave me his word  i said where are we going he said wed be back by the fourth  i said thats the best news that ive ever heard  i was thinking about turquoise i was thinking about gold  i was thinking about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace  as we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  i was thinking about isis how she thought i was so reckless  how she told me that one day we would meet up again  and things would be different the next time we wed  if i only could hang on and just be her friend  i still cant remember all the best things she said  we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  he said theres a body im trying to find  if i carry it out itll bring a good price  twas then that i knew what he had on his mind  the wind it was ahowlin and the snow was outrageous  we chopped through the night  and we chopped through the dawn  when he died i was hoping that it wasnt contagious  but i made up my mind that i had to go on  i broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  there was no jewels no nothing i felt id been had  when i saw that my partner was just being friendly  when i took up his offer i mustve been mad  i picked up his body and i dragged him inside  threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover  i said a quick prayer then i felt satisfied  then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her  she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes  i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead  she said where you been i said no place special  she said you look different i said well i guess  she said you been gone i said thats only natural  she said you going to stay i said if you want me to yes  isis oh isis you mystical child  what drives me to you is what drives me insane  i still can remember the way that you smiled  on the fifth day of may in the drizzling rain oxford town

pits ran aplenty  but the cardboard filled windows  and old men on the benches  tell you now that the whole town is empty  in the north end of town  my own children are grown  well i was raised on the other  in the wee hours of youth  my mother took sick  and i was brought up by my brother  the iron ore poured  as the years passed the door  the drag lines and the shovels they was ahummin  til one day my brother  failed to come home  the same as my father before him  well a long winters wait  from the winda i watched  my friends they couldnta been kinder  and my school it was cut  as i quit in the spring  to marry john thomas a miner  oh the years passed again  and the givin was good  with the lunch bucket filled every season  what with three babies born  the work was cut down  to a half a days shift with no reason  then the shaft was soon shut  and more work was cut  and the fire in the air it felt frozen  til a man come to speak  and he said in one week  that number eleven was closin  they complained in the east  theyre payin too high  they say that your ore aint worth adiggin  that its much cheaper down  in the south american towns  where the miners work almost for nothin  so the minin gates locked  and the red iron rotted  and the room smelled heavy from drinkin  when the sad silent song  made the hour twice as long  as i waited for the sun to go sinking  i lived by the window  as he talked to himself  this silence of tongues it was buildin  til one mornings wake  the bed it was bare  and is left alone with three children  the summer is gone  the grounds turning cold  the stores one by one theyre afoldin  my children will go  as soon they grow  well there aint nothin here now to hold them perhaps its the color of the sun cut flat  and covering the crossroads im standing at  or maybe its the weather or something like that  but mama you been on my mind  i dont mean trouble please dont put me down or get upset  i am not pleading or saying i cant forget you  i do not pace the floor bowed down and bent but yet  mama you been on my mind  even though my eyes are hazy  and my thoughts they might be narrow  where you been dont bother me  or bring me down with

afalling  the dogs will lose their bark  and the silent night will shatter  from the sounds inside my mind  yes im one too many mornings  and a thousand miles behind  from the crossroads of my doorstep  my eyes start to fade  and i turn my head back to the room  where my love and i have laid  and i gaze back to the street  the sidewalk and the sign  and im one too many mornings  and a thousand miles behind  its a restless hungry feeling  that dont mean no one no good  when everything im asayin  you can say it just as good  youre right from your side  im right from mine  were both

in a dirty gondola  oh to be back in the land of cocacola  i left rome and landed in brussels  on a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried  clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels  everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside  newspapermen eating candy  had to be held down by big police  someday everything is going to be different  when i paint my masterpiece there is a

well climb that hill no matter how steep  when we get up to it  whooee ride me high  tomorrows the day  my brides going to come  oh oh are we going to fly  down in the easy chair twas down in mississippi no so long ago  when a young boy from chicago town stepped through a southern door  this boys dreadful tragedy i can still remember well  the color of his skin was black and his name was emmett till  some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up  they said they had a reason but i cant remember what  they tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat  there was screaming sounds inside the barn there was laughing sounds out on the street  then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain  and they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain  the reason that they killed him there and im sure it aint no lie  was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die  and then to stop the united states of yelling for a trial  two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor emmett till  but on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime  and so this trial was a mockery but nobody there seemed to mind  i saw the morning papers but i could not bear to see  the smiling brothers walking down the courthouse stairs  for the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free  while emmetts body floats the foam of a jim crow southern sea  if you cant speak out against this kind of thing a crime thats so unjust  your eyes are filled with dead mens dirt your mind is filled with dust  your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains and your blood it must refuse to flow  for you to let this human race fall down so godawful low  this songs just a reminder to remind your fellow man  that this kind of thing still lives today in that ghostrobed ku klux klan  but if all of us folks that thinks alike if we gave all we could give  we could make this great land of ours a greater place to live seen the arrow on the doorpost  saying this land is condemned  all the way from new orleans  to jerusalem  i traveled through east texas  where many martyrs fell  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  well i heard that hoot owl singing  as they were taking down the tents  the stars above the barren trees  was his only audience  them charcoal gypsy maidens  can strut their feathers well  but nobody can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  see them big plantations burning  hear the cracking of the whips  smell that sweet magnolia blooming  see the ghosts of slavery ships  i can hear them tribes moaning  hear that undertakers bell  nobody can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  theres a woman by the river  with some fine young handsome man  hes dressed up like a squire  bootlegged whiskey in his hand  theres a chain gang on the highway  i can hear them rebels yell  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell  well god is in his heaven  and we all want whats his  but power and greed and corruptible seed  seem to be all that there is  im gazing out the window  of the st james hotel  and i know no one can sing the blues  like blind willie mctell standing on the waters casting your bread  while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing  distant ships sailing into the mist  you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing  freedom just around the corner for you  but with the truth so far off what good will it do  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  so swiftly the sun sets in the sky  you rise up and say goodbye to no one  fools rush in where angels fear to tread  both of their futures so full of dread you dont show one  shedding off one more layer of skin  keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  youre a man of the mountains you can walk on the clouds  manipulator of crowds youre a dream twister  youre going to sodom and gomorrah  but what do you care aint nobody there would want to marry your sister  friend to the martyr a friend to the woman of shame  you look into the fiery furnace see the rich man without any name  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  well the book of leviticus and deuteronomy  the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers  in the smoke of the twilight on a milkwhite steed  michelangelo indeed couldve carved out your features  resting in the fields far from the turbulent space  half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  well the riflemans stalking the sick and the lame  preacherman seeks the same wholl get there first is uncertain  nightsticks and water cannons tear gas padlocks  molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain  falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin  only a matter of time till night comes stepping in  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman  its a shadowy world skies are slippery grey  a woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet  hell put the priest in his pocket put the blade to the heat  take the motherless children off the street  and place them at the feet of a harlot  oh jokerman you know what he wants  oh jokerman you dont show any response  jokerman dance to the nightingale tune  bird fly high by the light of the moon  oh oh oh jokerman'"
