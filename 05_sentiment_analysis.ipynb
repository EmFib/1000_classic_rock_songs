sees the bartender in a pool of blood\\nCries out, “My God, they killed them all!”\\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\nFor something that he never done\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\nThe champion of the world\\nThree bodies lyin\\' there\\nDoes Patty see\\nAnd another man named Bello\\nMoving around mysteriously\\n“I didn’t do it,” he says\\nAnd he throws up his hands\\n“I was only robbin\\' the register\\nI hope you understand\\nI saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops\\n“One of us had better call up the cops”\\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\\nAnd they arrive on the scene\\nWith their red lights flashin\\'\\nIn the hot New Jersey night\\nMeanwhile, far away in another part of town\\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin\\' around\\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\\nJust like the time before and the time before that\\nIn Paterson that’s just the way things go\\nIf you’re black\\nYou might as well not show up on the street\\nUnless you want to draw the heat\\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around\\nHe said, “I saw two men running out\\nThey looked like middleweights\\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”\\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\\nCop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”\\nSo they took him to the infirmary\\nAnd though this man could hardly see\\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\\nFour in the morning and they haul Rubin in\\nThey take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs\\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dying eye\\nSays, “Why did you bring him in here for?\\nHe ain\\'t the guy!”\\nHere’s the story of the Hurricane\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\nFor something that he never done\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\nThe champion of the world\\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\\nRubin’s in South America, fighting for his name\\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him\\nLookin\\' for somebody to blame\\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw\\nRunning that night?”\\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\\nThe cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\\nWe got you for the motel job\\nAnd we’re talking to your friend Bello\\nNow you don’t want to have to go back to jail\\nBe a nice fellow\\nYou’ll be doing society a favor\\nThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin\\' braver\\nWe want to put his ass in stir\\nWe want to pin this triple murder\\nOn him\\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\\n\"It’s my work\", he’d say, \"and I do it for pay\\nAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\"\\nUp to some paradise\\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\\nWhere they try to turn a man\\nInto a mouse\\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\\nThe trial was a pig-circus\\nHe never had a chance\\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses\\nDrunkards from the slums\\nTo the white folks who watched\\nHe was a revolutionary bum\\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\\nThe D.A. said he was the one\\nWho did the deed\\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\\nThe crime was murder “one,”\\nGuess who testified?\\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\\nHow can the life of such a man\\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\\nTo see him obviously framed\\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed\\nTo live in a land\\nWhere justice is a game\\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\\nAre free to drink Martinis\\nAnd watch the sun rise\\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha\\nIn a ten-foot cell\\nAn innocent man in a living hell\\nYes that’s the story of the Hurricane\\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\nThe champion of the world Well, it ain\\'t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\nIf\\'n you don\\'t know by now\\nAnd it ain\\'t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\nIt\\'ll never do somehow\\nWhen your rooster crows at the break of dawn\\nLook out your window and I\\'ll be gone\\nYou\\'re the reason I\\'m a-traveling on\\nBut don\\'t think twice,

wish there was something you would do or say\\nTo try and make me change my mind and stay\\nBut we never did too much talking anyway\\nBut don\\'t think twice, it\\'s all right\\nSo it ain\\'t no use in calling out my name, gal\\nLike you never done before\\nAnd it ain\\'t no use in calling out my name, gal\\nI can\\'t hear you anymore\\nI\\'m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road\\nI

too good a word, babe\\nSo I\\'ll just say, \"Fare thee well\"\\nI ain\\'t a-saying you treated me unkind\\nYou could\\'ve done better, but I don\\'t mind\\nYou just kinda wasted my precious

highways\\nI’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests\\nI’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans\\nI’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard\\nAnd it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard\\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall\\nOh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?\\nAnd what did you see, my darling young one?\\nI saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it\\nI saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it\\nI saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping\\nI saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding\\nI saw a white ladder all covered with water\\nI saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken\\nI saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children\\nAnd it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard\\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall\\nAnd what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?\\nAnd what did you hear, my darling young one?\\nI heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning\\nI heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world\\nI heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing\\nI heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening\\nI heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing\\nI heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter\\nI heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley\\nAnd it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard\\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall\\nOh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?\\nAnd who did you meet, my darling young one?\\nI met a young child beside a dead pony\\nI met a white man who walked a black dog\\nI met a young woman, her body was burning\\nI met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow\\nI met one man who was wounded in love\\nI met another man who was wounded in hatred\\nAnd it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard\\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall\\nAnd what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?\\nAnd what will you do now, my darling young one?\\nI’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling\\nI’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest\\nWhere the people are many and their hands are all empty\\nWhere the pellets of poison are flooding their waters\\nWhere the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\\nAnd the executioner’s face is always well hidden\\nWhere hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten\\nWhere black is the color, where none is the number\\nAnd I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it\\nAnd reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it\\nThen I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking\\nBut I’ll know my song well before I start singing\\nAnd it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard\\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall Come, you masters of war\\nYou that build the big guns\\nYou that build the death planes\\nYou that build all the bombs\\nYou that hide behind walls\\nYou that hide behind desks\\nI just want you to know\\nI can see through your masks\\nYou that never done nothing\\nBut build to destroy\\nYou play with my world\\nLike it\\'s your little toy\\nYou put a gun in my hand\\nAnd you hide from my eyes\\nAnd you turn and run farther\\nWhen the fast bullets fly\\nLike Judas of old\\nYou lie and deceive\\nA world war can be won\\nYou want me to believe\\nBut I see through your eyes\\nAnd I see through your brain\\nLike I see through the water\\nThat runs down my drain\\nYou fasten all the triggers\\nFor the others to fire\\nThen you set back and watch\\nWhile the death count gets higher\\nYou hide in your mansion\\nWhile the young people\\'s blood\\nFlows out of their bodies\\nAnd is buried in the mud\\nYou\\'ve thrown the worst fear\\nThat can ever be hurled\\nFear to bring children\\nInto the world\\nFor threatening my baby\\nUnborn and unnamed\\nYou ain\\'t worth the blood\\nThat runs in your veins\\nHow much do I know\\nTo talk out of turn?\\nYou might say that I\\'m young\\nYou might say I\\'m unlearned\\nBut there\\'s one thing I know\\nThough I\\'m younger than you\\nThat even Jesus would never\\nForgive what you do\\nLet me ask you one question\\nIs your money that good?\\nWill it buy you forgiveness?\\nDo you think that it could?\\nI think you will find\\nWhen your death takes its toll\\nAll the money you made\\nWill never buy back your soul\\nAnd I hope that you die\\nAnd your death will come soon\\nI will follow your casket\\nBy the pale afternoon\\nAnd I\\'ll watch while you\\'re lowered\\nDown to your deathbed\\nAnd I\\'ll stand over your grave\\n\\'Til I\\'m sure that you\\'re dead Ooh, ooh\\nOoh, ooh\\nMama,

that’s left\\nAfter the ambulances go\\nIs Cinderella sweeping up\\nOn Desolation Row\\nNow the moon is almost hidden\\nThe stars are beginning to hide\\nThe fortune-telling lady\\nHas even taken all her things inside\\nAll except for Cain and Abel\\nAnd the hunchback of Notre Dame\\nEverybody is making love\\nOr else expecting rain\\nAnd the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing\\nHe’s getting ready for the show\\nHe’s going to the carnival tonight\\nOn Desolation Row\\nOphelia, she’s ’neath the window\\nFor her I feel so afraid\\nOn her twenty-second birthday\\nShe already is an old maid\\nTo her, death is quite romantic\\nShe wears an iron vest\\nHer profession’s her religion\\nHer sin is her lifelessness\\nAnd though her eyes are fixed upon\\nNoah’s great rainbow\\nShe spends her time peeking\\nInto Desolation Row\\nEinstein, disguised as Robin Hood\\nWith his memories in a trunk\\nPassed this way an hour ago\\nWith his friend, a jealous monk\\nNow he looked so immaculately frightful\\nAs he bummed a cigarette\\nThen he went off sniffing drainpipes\\nAnd reciting the alphabet\\nYou would not think to look at him\\nBut he was famous long ago\\nFor playing the electric violin\\nOn Desolation Row\\nDr. Filth, he keeps his world\\nInside of a leather cup\\nBut all his sexless patients\\nThey’re trying to blow it up\\nNow his nurse, some local loser\\nShe’s in charge of the cyanide hole\\nAnd she also keeps the cards that read\\n“Have mercy on his soul”\\nThey all play on the pennywhistle\\nYou can hear them blow\\nIf you lean your head out far enough\\nFrom Desolation Row\\nAcross the street they’ve nailed the curtains\\nThey’re getting ready for the feast\\nThe Phantom of the Opera\\nIn a perfect image of a priest\\nThey are spoon feeding Casanova\\nTo get him to feel more assured\\nThen they’ll kill him with self-confidence\\nAfter poisoning him with words\\nAnd the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls\\n“Get outta here if you don’t know\\nCasanova is just being punished for going\\nTo Desolation Row”\\nAt midnight all the agents\\nAnd the superhuman crew\\nCome out and round up everyone\\nThat knows more than they do\\nThen they bring them to the factory\\nWhere the heart attack machine\\nIs strapped across their shoulders\\nAnd then the kerosene\\nIs brought down from the castles\\nBy insurance men who go\\nCheck to see that nobody is escaping\\nTo Desolation Row\\nPraise be to Nero’s Neptune\\nThe Titanic sails at dawn\\nEverybody’s shouting\\n“Which side are you on?”\\nAnd Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot\\nFighting in the captain’s tower\\nWhile calypso singers laugh at them\\nAnd fishermen hold flowers\\nBetween the windows of the sea\\nWhere lovely mermaids flow\\nAnd nobody has to think too much\\nAbout Desolation Row\\nYes, I received your letter yesterday\\nAbout the time the doorknob broke\\nWhen you asked me how I was doing\\nWas that some kinda joke?\\nAll these people that you mention\\nYes, I know them, they’re quite lame\\nI had to rearrange their faces\\nAnd give them all another name\\nRight now, I can’t read too good\\nDon’t send me no more letters, no\\nNot unless you mail them\\nFrom Desolation Row Early one morning the sun was shining\\nI was laying in bed\\nWondering if she\\'d changed at all\\nIf her hair was still red\\nHer folks they said our lives together\\nSure was going to be rough\\nThey never did like Mama\\'s homemade dress\\nPapa\\'s bankbook wasn\\'t big enough\\nAnd I was standing on the side of the road\\nRain falling on my shoes\\nHeading out for the East Coast\\nLord knows I\\'ve paid some dues\\nGetting through\\nTangled up in blue\\nShe was married when we first met\\nSoon to be divorced\\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\\nBut I used a little too much force\\nWe drove that car as far as we could\\nAbandoned it out West\\nSplit up on a dark sad night\\nBoth agreeing it was best\\nShe turned around to look at me\\nAs I was walking away\\nI heard her say over my shoulder\\n\"We\\'ll meet again someday\\nOn the avenue\"\\nTangled up in blue\\nI had a job in the great north woods\\nWorking as a cook for a spell\\nBut I never did like it all that much\\nAnd one day the ax just fell\\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\\nWhere I lucky was to be employed\\nWorking for a while on a fishing boat\\nRight outside of Delacroix\\nBut all the while I was alone\\nThe past was close behind\\nI seen a lot of women\\nBut she never escaped my mind\\nAnd I just grew\\nTangled up in blue\\nShe was working in a topless place\\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\\nI just kept looking at the side of her face\\nIn the spotlight, so clear\\nAnd later on, when the crowd thinned out\\nI was just about to do the same\\nShe was standing there, in back of my chair\\nSaid to me \"Tell me, don\\'t I know your name?\"\\nI muttered something underneath my breath\\nShe studied the lines on my face\\nI must admit, I felt a little uneasy\\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces\\nOf my shoe\\nTangled up in blue\\nShe lit a burner on the stove\\nAnd offered me a pipe\\n\"I thought you\\'d never say hello\" she said\\n\"You look like the silent type\"\\nThen she opened up a book of poems\\nAnd handed it to me\\nWritten by an Italian poet\\nFrom the thirteenth century\\nAnd every one of them words rang true\\nAnd glowed like burning coal\\nPouring off of every page\\nLike it was written in my soul\\nFrom me to you\\nTangled up in blue\\nI lived with them on Montague Street\\nIn a basement down the stairs\\nThere was music in the cafes at night\\nAnd revolution in the air\\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\\nAnd something inside of him died\\nShe had to sell everything she owned\\nAnd froze up inside\\nAnd when it finally, the bottom fell out\\nI became withdrawn\\nThe only thing I knew how to do\\nWas to keep on keeping on\\nLike a bird that flew\\nTangled up in blue\\nSo now I\\'m going back again\\nI got to get to her somehow\\nAll the people we used to know\\nThey\\'re an illusion to me now\\nSome are mathematicians\\nSome are carpenter\\'s wives\\nDon\\'t know how it all got started\\nI don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with their lives\\nBut me, I\\'m still on the road\\nA-heading for another joint\\nWe always did feel the same\\nWe just saw it from a different point\\nOf view\\nTangled up in blue If you’re travelin\\' in the north country fair\\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\\nRemember me to one who lives there\\nFor she once was a true love of mine\\nIf you go when the snowflakes storm\\nWhen the rivers freeze and summer ends\\nPlease see if she has a coat so warm\\nTo keep her from the howling winds\\nPlease see if her hair hangs long\\nIf it rolls and flows all down her breast\\nPlease see for me if her hair\\'s hangin\\' long\\nFor that’s the way I remember her best\\nI’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all\\nMany times I’ve often prayed\\nIn the darkness of my night\\nIn the brightness of my day\\nSo if you’re travelin\\' the north country fair\\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\\nRemember me to one who lives there\\nFor she once was a true love of mine The pale moon rose in its glory\\nOut o\\'er the Western town\\nShe told a sad, sad story\\nOf the great ship that went down\\nT\\'was the fourteenth day of April\\nOver the waves she rode\\nSailing into tomorrow\\nTo a gilded age foretold\\nThe night was black with starlight\\nThe seas were sharp and clear\\nMoving through the shadows\\nThe promised hour was near\\nLights were holding steady\\nGliding over the foam\\nAll the lords and ladies\\nHeading for their eternal home\\nThe chandeliers were swaying\\nFrom the balustrades above\\nThe orchestra was playing\\nSongs of faded love\\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\nInto the underworld\\nLeo took his sketchbook\\nHe was often so inclined\\nHe closed his eyes and painted\\nThe scenery in his mind\\nCupid struck his bosom\\nAnd broke it with a snap\\nThe closest woman to him\\nHe fell into her lap\\nHe heard a loud commotion\\nSomething sounded wrong\\nHis inner spirit was saying\\nThat he couldn\\'t stand here long\\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\\nNo time now to sleep\\nWater on the quarterdeck\\nAlready three foot deep\\nSmokestack was leaning sideways\\nHeavy feet began to pound\\nHe walked into the whirlwind\\nSky splitting all around\\nThe ship was going under\\nThe universe had opened wide\\nThe roll was called up yonder\\nThe angels turned aside\\nLights down in the hallway\\nFlickering dim and dull\\nDead bodies already floating\\nIn the double bottom hull\\nThe engines then exploded\\nPropellers they failed to start\\nThe boilers overloaded\\nThe ship\\'s bow split apart\\nPassengers were flying\\nBackward, forward, far and fast\\nThey mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled\\nEach one more weary than the last\\nThe veil was torn asunder\\n\\'Tween the hours of twelve and one\\nNo change, no sudden wonder\\nCould undo what had been done\\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\\nAt forty-five degrees\\nHe dreamed that the Titanic was sinking\\nDropping to her knees\\nWellington he was sleeping\\nHis bed began to slide\\nHis valiant heart was beating\\nHe pushed the tables aside\\nGlass of shattered crystal\\nLay scattered roundabout\\nHe strapped on both his pistols\\nHow long could he hold out?\\nHis men and his companions\\nWere nowhere to be seen\\nIn silence there he waited for\\nTime and space to intervene\\nThe passageway was narrow\\nThere was blackness in the air\\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\\nHeard voices everywhere\\nAlarm-bells were ringing\\nTo hold back the swelling tide\\nFriends and lovers clinging\\nTo each other side by side\\nMothers and their daughters\\nDescending down the stairs\\nJumped into the icy waters\\nLove and pity sent their prayers\\nThe rich man, Mister Astor\\nKissed his darling wife\\nHe had no way of knowing\\nBe the last trip of his life\\nCalvin, Blake, and Wilson\\nGambled in the dark\\nNot one of them would ever live to\\nTell the tale or disembark\\nBrother rose up \\'gainst brother\\nIn every circumstance\\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\\nIn a deadly dance\\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\\nFrom the sinking wreck\\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\\nBroken backs and broken necks\\nThe bishop left his cabin\\nTo help all those in need\\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\\nSaid, \"The poor are yours to feed\"\\nDavey the brothel-keeper\\nCame out dismissed his girls\\nSaw the water getting deeper\\nSaw the changing of his world\\nJim Backus smiled\\nHe never learned to swim\\nSaw the little crippled child\\nAnd he gave his seat to him\\nHe saw the starlight shining\\nStreaming from the East\\nDeath was on the rampage\\nBut his heart was now at peace\\nThey battened down the hatches\\nBut the hatches wouldn\\'t hold\\nThey drowned upon the staircase\\nOf brass and polished gold\\nLeo said to Cleo\\nI think I\\'m going mad\\nBut he\\'d lost his mind already\\nWhatever mind he had\\nHe tried to block the doorway\\nTo save all those from harm\\nBlood from an open wound\\nPouring down his arm\\nPetals fell from flowers\\nTell all of them were gone\\nIn the long and dreadful hours\\nThe wizard\\'s curse played on\\nThe host was pouring brandy\\nHe was going down slow\\nHe stayed right to the end and he\\nWas the last to go\\nThere were many, many others\\nNameless here forever more\\nThey never sailed the ocean\\nOr left their homes before\\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\\nThe damage had been done\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\nAnd he tried to tell someone\\nThe captain, barely breathing\\nKneeling at the wheel\\nAbove him and beneath him\\nFifty thousand tons of steel\\nHe looked over at his compass\\nAnd he gazed into its face\\nNeedle pointing downward\\nHe knew he lost the race\\nIn the dark illumination\\nHe remembered bygone years\\nHe read the Book of Revelation\\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\\nWhen the Reaper\\'s task had ended\\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\\nThe loveliest and the best\\nThey waited at the landing\\nAnd they tried to understand\\nBut there is no understanding\\nFor the judgment of God\\'s hand\\nThe news came over the wires\\nAnd struck with deadly force\\nThe love had lost its fires\\nAll things had run their course\\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\\nOf all the things that can be\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\nInto the deep blue sea Darkness at the break of noon\\nShadows even the silver spoon\\nThe handmade blade, the child\\'s balloon\\nEclipses both the sun and moon\\nTo understand you know too soon\\nThere is no sense in trying\\nPointed threats they bluff with scorn\\nSuicide remarks are torn\\nFrom the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn\\nPlays wasted words, proves to warn\\nThat he not busy being born\\nIs busy dying\\nTemptation\\'s page flies out the door\\nYou follow, find yourself at war\\nWatch waterfalls of pity roar\\nYou feel to moan, but unlike before\\nYou discover that you\\'d just be one more\\nPerson crying\\nSo don\\'t fear if you hear\\nA foreign sound to your ear\\nIt\\'s alright, Ma, I\\'m only sighing\\nAs some warn victory, some downfall\\nPrivate reasons, great or small\\nCan be seen in the eyes of those that call\\nTo make all that should be killed to crawl\\nWhile others say don\\'t hate nothing at all\\nExcept hatred\\nDisillusioned words like bullets bark\\nAs human gods aim for their mark\\nMake everything from toy guns that spark\\nTo flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark\\nIt\\'s easy to see without lookin\\' too far\\nThat not much is really sacred\\nWhile preachers preach of evil fates\\nTeachers teach that knowledge waits\\nCan lead to hundred-dollar plates\\nGoodness hides behind its gates\\nBut even the President of the United States\\nSometimes must have to stand naked\\nAnd though the rules of the road have been lodged\\nIt\\'s only people\\'s games that you got to dodge\\nAnd it\\'s alright, Ma, I can make it\\nAdvertising signs that con\\nYou into thinking you\\'re the one\\nThat can do what\\'s never been done\\nThat can win what\\'s never been won\\nMeantime, life outside goes on\\nAll around you\\nYou lose yourself, you reappear\\nYou suddenly find you got nothing to fear\\nAlone you stand with nobody near\\nWhen a trembling distant voice, unclear\\nStartles your sleeping ears to hear\\nThat somebody thinks they really found you\\nA question in your nerves is lit\\nYet you know there is no answer fit\\nTo satisfy, ensure you not to quit\\nTo keep it in your mind and not forget\\nThat it is not he, or she, or them, or it\\nThat you belong to\\nBut though the masters make the rules\\nFor the wise men and the fools\\nI got nothing, Ma, to live up to\\nFor them that must obey authority\\nThat they do not respect in any degree\\nWho despise their jobs, their destiny\\nSpeak jealously of them that are free\\nDo what they do just to be\\nNothing more than something they invest in\\nWhile some on principles baptized\\nTo strict party platform ties\\nSocial clubs in drag disguise\\nOutsiders they can freely criticize\\nTell nothing except who to idolize\\nAnd say \"God bless him\"\\nWhile one who sings with his tongue on fire\\nGargles in the rat race choir\\nBent out of shape from society\\'s pliers\\nCares not to come up any higher\\nBut rather get you down in the hole\\nThat he\\'s in\\nBut I mean no harm, nor put fault\\nOn anyone that lives in a vault\\nBut it\\'s alright, Ma, if I can\\'t please him\\nOld lady judges watch people in pairs\\nLimited in sex, they dare\\nTo push fake morals, insult and stare\\nWhile money doesn\\'t talk, it swears\\nObscenity, who really cares\\nPropaganda, all is phony\\nWhile them that defend what they cannot see\\nWith a killer\\'s pride, security\\nIt blows the minds most bitterly\\nFor them that think death\\'s honesty\\nWon\\'t fall upon \\'em naturally\\nLife sometimes must get lonely\\nMy eyes collide head-on with stuffed\\nGraveyards, false goals, I scuff\\nAt pettiness which plays so rough\\nWalk upside down inside handcuffs\\nKick my legs to crash it off\\nSay, okay, I\\'ve had enough\\nWhat else can you show me?\\nAnd if my thought-dreams could be seen\\nThey\\'d probably put my head in a guillotine\\nBut it\\'s alright, Ma, it\\'s life, and life only Today, and tomorrow, and yesterday, too\\nThe flowers are dyin\\' like all things do\\nFollow me close,\\u2005I’m\\u2005going to Bally-na-Lee\\nI\\'ll\\u2005lose my mind if you don\\'t\\u2005come with me\\nI fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds\\nI contain multitudes\\nGot a tell-tale heart like Mr. Poe\\nGot skeletons in the walls of people you know\\nI’ll drink to the truth and the things we said\\nI\\'ll drink to the man that shares your bed\\nI paint landscapes, and I paint nudes\\nI contain multitudes\\nA red Cadillac and a black mustache\\nRings on my fingers that sparkle and flash\\nTell me, what\\'s next? What shall we do?\\nHalf my soul, baby, belongs to you\\nI rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes\\nI contain multitudes\\nI\\'m just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones\\nAnd them British bad boys, the Rolling Stones\\nI go right to the edge, I go right to the end\\nI go right where all things lost are made good again\\nI sing the songs of experience like William Blake\\nI have no apologies to make\\nEverything\\'s flowing all at the same time\\nI live on a boulevard of crime\\nI drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods\\nI contain multitudes\\nPink pedal-pushers, red blue jeans\\nAll the pretty maids, and all the old queens\\nAll the old queens from all my past lives\\nI carry four pistols and two large knives\\nI\\'m a man of contradictions, I\\'m a man of many moods\\nI contain multitudes\\nYou greedy old wolf, I\\'ll show you my heart\\nBut not all of it, only the hateful parts\\nI’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head\\nWhat more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed\\nGet lost, madame, get up off my knee\\nKeep your mouth away from me\\nI\\'ll keep the path open, the path in my mind\\nI’ll see to it that there\\'s no love left behind\\nI\\'ll play Beethoven\\'s sonatas, Chopin’s preludes\\nI contain multitudes You must leave now\\nTake what you need, you think will last\\nBut whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast\\nYonder stands your orphan with his gun\\nCrying like a fire in the sun\\nLook out, the saints are coming through\\nAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue\\nThe highway is for gamblers, better use your sense\\nTake what you have gathered from coincidence\\nThe empty handed painter from your streets\\nIs drawing crazy patterns on your sheets\\nThe sky, too, is folding under you\\nAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue\\nAll your seasick sailors, they are rowing home\\nAll your reindeer armies are all going home\\nYour lover who just walked out the door\\nHas taken all his blankets from the floor\\nThe carpet, too, is moving under you\\nAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue\\nLeave your stepping stones behind\\nThere\\'s something that calls for you\\nForget the dead you\\'ve left\\nThey will not follow you\\nThe vagabond who\\'s rapping at your door\\nIs standing in the clothes that you once wore\\nStrike another match, go start anew\\nAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue A tear goes down my day is real\\nBut your drying eye upon the shame\\nEach needs a road for me from you\\nWhat paradise? what can I do?\\nThat die for my and the day is dark\\nI can’t believe for your touch\\nWhat I could find oh time is right\\nIf I fell in love to fall in love\\nTo fall in love with you\\nThe day is dark, our time is right\\nDay in the night deep in the night\\nI can’t yet be back I heard my- surprise\\nI see it in your lips I knew it in your eyes\\nWell I feel your love and I feel no shame\\nI can’t unleash your horde I call your name\\nWhat you’re to me what can I do?\\nTo fall in love to fall in love\\nTo fall in love with you\\nIt just rolls upon the sand\\nEver this for now I’m made a man\\nCan make you see what I can find\\nI know it in my days ah in my daily mind\\nOh will ages roll will ages fly?\\nI hear your name where angels lie\\nWhat do I know? for to come it’s true\\nTo fall in love To fall in love\\nTo fall in love with you\\nHow can the doors trust on a nail?\\nHow can I be surprised of most every day?\\nIn the distant road I can’t be the same\\nI feel no love I feel no shame\\nI can’t watch the bay out on my own\\nWe’ve a destined man I can attest it all\\nI didn’t I could find where I could go\\nTo fall in love to fall in love\\nTo fall in love with you Lay, lady, lay\\nLay across my big brass bed\\nLay, lady, lay\\nLay across my big brass bed\\nWhatever colors you have in your mind\\nI’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine\\nLay, lady, lay\\nLay across my big brass bed\\nStay, lady, stay\\nStay with your man awhile\\nUntil the break of day, let me see ya\\' make him smile\\nHis clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean\\nAnd you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen\\nStay, lady, stay\\nStay with your man awhile\\nWhy wait any longer for the world to begin\\nYou can have your cake and eat it too\\nWhy wait any longer for the one you love\\nWhen he’s standing in front of you\\nLay, lady,

while the night is still ahead Someone’s got it in for me\\nThey’re planting stories in the press\\nWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick\\nBut when they will I can only guess\\nThey say I shot a man named Gray\\nAnd took his wife to Italy\\nShe inherited a million bucks\\nAnd when she died it came to me\\nI can’t help it if I’m lucky\\nPeople see me all the time\\nAnd they just can’t remember how to act\\nTheir minds are filled with big ideas\\nImages and distorted facts\\nEven you, yesterday\\nYou had to ask me where it was at\\nI couldn’t believe after all these years\\nYou didn’t know me any better than that\\nSweet lady\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing every time you move your mouth\\nBlowing down the backroads heading south\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing every time you move your teeth\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\nI ran into the fortune-teller\\nWho said beware of lightning that might strike\\nI haven’t known peace and quiet\\nFor so long, I can’t remember what it’s like\\nThere’s a lone soldier on the cross\\nSmoke pouring out of a boxcar door\\nYou didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done\\nIn the final end he won the war\\nAfter losing every battle\\nI woke up on the roadside\\nDaydreaming about the way things sometimes are\\nVisions of your chestnut mare\\nShoot through my head and are making me see stars\\nYou hurt the ones that I love best\\nAnd cover up the truth with lies\\nOne day you’ll be in the ditch\\nFlies buzzing around your eyes\\nBlood on your saddle\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing through the flowers on your tomb\\nBlowing through the curtains in your room\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing every time you move your teeth\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\nIt was gravity which pulled us down\\nAnd destiny which broke us apart\\nYou tamed the lion in my cage\\nBut it just wasn’t enough to change my heart\\nNow everything’s a little upside down\\nAs a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped\\nWhat’s good is bad, what’s bad is good\\nYou’ll find out when you reach the top\\nYou’re on the bottom\\nI noticed at the ceremony\\nYour corrupt ways had finally made you blind\\nI can’t remember your face anymore\\nYour mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine\\nThe priest wore black on the seventh day\\nAnd sat stone-faced while the building burned\\nI waited for you on the running boards\\nNear the cypress trees, while the springtime turned\\nSlowly into Autumn\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing like a circle around my skull\\nFrom the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing every time you move your teeth\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\nI can’t feel you anymore\\nI can’t even touch the books you’ve read\\nEvery time I crawl past your door\\nI been wishing I\\'ve been somebody else instead\\nDown the highway, down the tracks\\nDown the road to ecstasy\\nI followed you beneath the stars\\nHounded by your memory\\nAnd all your raging glory\\nI been double-crossed now\\nFor the very last time and now I’m finally free\\nI kissed goodbye the howling beast\\nOn the borderline which separated you from me\\nYou’ll never know the hurt I suffered\\nNor the pain I rise above\\nAnd I’ll never know the same about you\\nYour holiness or your kind of love\\nAnd it makes me feel so sorry\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing through the buttons of our coats\\nBlowing through the letters that we wrote\\nIdiot wind\\nBlowing through the dust upon our shelves\\nWe’re idiots, babe\\nIt’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves \\'Twas in another lifetime\\nOne of toil and blood\\nWhen blackness was a virtue\\nThe road was full of mud\\nI came in from the wilderness\\nA creature void of form\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nAnd if I pass this way again\\nYou can rest assured\\nI\\'ll always do my best for her\\nOn that I give my word\\nIn a world of steel-eyed death and men\\nWho are fighting to be warm\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nNot a word was spoke between us\\nThere was little risk involved\\nEverything up to that point\\nHad been left unresolved\\nTry imagining a place\\nWhere it\\'s always safe and warm\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nI was burned out from exhaustion\\nBuried in the hail\\nPoisoned in the bushes\\nAnd blown out on the trail\\nHunted like a crocodile\\nRavaged in the corn\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nSuddenly I turned around\\nAnd she was standing there\\nWith silver bracelets on her wrists\\nAnd flowers in her hair\\nShe walked up to me so gracefully\\nAnd took my crown of thorns\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nNow there\\'s a wall between us\\nSomething there\\'s been lost\\nI took too much for granted\\nI got my signals crossed\\nJust to think that it all began\\nOn an uneventful morn\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nWell the deputy walks on hard nails\\nAnd the preacher rides a mount\\nBut nothing really matters much\\nIt\\'s doom alone that counts\\nAnd the one-eyed undertaker\\nHe blows a futile horn\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\\nI\\'ve heard newborn babies wailing\\nLike a mourning dove\\nAnd old men with broken teeth\\nStranded without love\\nDo I understand your question, then\\nIs it hopeless and forlorn\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nIn a little hilltop village\\nThey gambled for my clothes\\nI bargained for salvation\\nAnd she gave me a lethal dose\\nI offered up my innocence\\nAnd I got repaid with scorn\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\"\\nWell, I\\'m living in a foreign country\\nBut I\\'m bound to cross the line\\nBeauty walks a razor\\'s edge\\nSomeday I\\'ll make it mine\\nIf I could only turn back the clock\\nTo when God and her were born\\n\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give ya\\nShelter from the storm\" Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin\\' to be so quiet?\\nWe sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it\\nAnd Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it\\nLights flicker from the opposite loft\\nIn this room the heat pipes just cough\\nThe country music station plays soft\\nBut there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off\\nJust Louise and her lover so entwined\\nAnd these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind\\nIn the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain\\nAnd the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train\\nWe can hear the night watchman click his flashlight\\nAsk himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane\\nLouise, she’s all right, she’s just near\\nShe’s delicate and seems like the mirror\\nBut she just makes it all too concise and too clear\\nThat Johanna’s not here\\nThe ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face\\nWhere these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\\nNow, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously\\nHe brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously\\nAnd when bringing her name up\\nHe speaks of a farewell kiss to me\\nHe’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all\\nMuttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall\\nHow can I explain?\\nIt\\'s so hard to get on\\nAnd these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn\\nInside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial\\nVoices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\\nBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\\nYou can tell by the way she smiles\\nSee the primitive wallflower freeze\\nWhen the jelly-faced women all sneeze\\nHear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze\\nI can’t find my knees”\\nOh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule\\nBut these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\\nThe peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him\\nSayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”\\nBut like Louise always says\\n“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”\\nAs she, herself, prepares for him\\nAnd Madonna, she still has not showed\\nWe see this empty cage now corrode\\nWhere her cape of the stage once had flowed\\nThe fiddler, he now steps to the road\\nHe writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed\\nOn the back of the fish truck that loads\\nWhile my conscience explodes\\nThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\\nAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”\\nAbe said, “Man, you must be puttin\\' me on”\\nGod say, “No.”\\nAbe say, “What?”\\nGod say, “You can do what you want, Abe, but\\nThe next time you see me comin\\' you better run”\\nWell Abe said, “Where you want this killin\\' done?”\\nGod said, “Out on Highway 61”\\nWell Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose\\nWelfare Department, they wouldn’t give him no clothes\\nHe asked poor Howard, \"Where can I go?\"\\nHoward said, \"There’s only one place I know\"\\nSam said, \"Tell me quick man, I got to run\"\\nOh Howard just pointed with his gun\\nAnd said, \"That way, down Highway 61\"\\nWell Mack the Finger said to Louie the King\\n\"I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings\\nAnd a thousand telephones that don’t ring\\nDo you know where I can get rid of these things?\"\\nAnd Louie the King said \"Let me think for a minute son\"\\nAnd he said \"Yes, I think it can be easily done\\nJust take everything down to Highway 61\"\\nNow the fifth daughter on the twelfth night\\nTold the first father that things weren’t right\\n\"My complexion\" she says \"is much too white\"\\nHe said \"Come here and step into the light\"\\nHe says \"Hmm you’re right\\nLet me tell the second mother this has been done\"\\nBut the second mother was with the seventh son\\nAnd they were both out on Highway 61\\nNow the rovin\\' gambler he was very bored\\nTryin\\' to create a next world war\\nHe found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor\\nHe said \"I never engaged in this kind of thing before\\nBut yes I think it can be very easily done\\nWe’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun\\nAnd have it on Highway 61\" Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing\\nBlowing like it\\'s gonna sweep my world away\\nI wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going\\nThat Duquesne

One time ago a crazy dream came to me\\nI dreamt I was walking to World War Three\\nI went to the doctor the very next day\\nTo see what kind of words he could say\\nHe said it was a bad dream\\n\"I wouldn’t worry about it none, though\\nThem old dreams are only in your head\"\\nI said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”\\nHe said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”\\nHe grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”\\nAs I landed on the psychiatric couch\\nHe said “Tell me about it”\\nWell, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast\\nIt was all over by a quarter past\\nI was down in the sewer with some little lover\\nWhen I peeked out from a manhole cover\\nWondering who turned the lights on us\\nWell, I got up and I walked around\\nUp and down the lonesome town\\nI stood a-wondering which way to go\\nI lit a cigarette on a parking meter\\nAnd walked on down the road\\nIt was a normal day\\nWell, I rung the fallout shelter bell\\nAnd I leaned my head and I give a yell\\n“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”\\nA shotgun fired, and away I ran\\nI don’t blame him too much though, he didn\\'t know me\\nDown at the corner by the hot-dog stand\\nI seen a man\\nI said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”\\nHe screamed a bit, and away he flew\\nThought I was a Communist\\nWell, I spied me a girl and before she could leave\\nI said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”\\nI took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping\\nWhen she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?\\nYou seen what happened last time they started”\\nWell, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown\\nThere was nobody around\\nI got into the driver’s seat\\nAnd I drove down 42nd Street\\nIn my Cadillac\\nGood car to drive after a war\\nWell, I remember seeing some ad\\nSo I turned on my Conelrad\\nBut I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill\\nSo the radio didn’t work so well\\nTurned on my record player —\\nIt was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa\\nOur Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”\\nI was feeling kind of lonesome and blue\\nI needed somebody to talk to\\nSo I called up the operator of time\\nJust to hear a voice of some kind\\n“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”\\nShe said that for over an hour\\nAnd I hung up\\nWell, the doctor interrupted me just about then\\nSaying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams\\nBut mine was a little different, you see\\nI dreamt the only person left after the war was me\\nI didn’t see you around\"\\nWell, now time passed and now it seems\\nEverybody’s having them dreams\\nEverybody sees their self\\nWalking around with no one else\\n\"Half of the people can be part right all of the time\\nAnd some of the people can be all right part of the time\\nBut all of the people can’t be all right all of the time\"\\nI think Abraham Lincoln said that\\n“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”\\nI said that Mother of Muses sing for me\\nSing of the mountains and the deep dark sea\\nSing of\\u2005the\\u2005lakes and the\\u2005nymphs of the forest\\nSing your hearts\\u2005out, all your women of the chorus\\nSing of honor and fate and glory be\\nMother of Muses sing for me\\nMother of Muses sing for my heart\\nSing of a love too soon to depart\\nSing of the heroes who stood alone\\nWhose names are engraved on tablets of stone\\nWho struggled with pain so the world could go free\\nMother of Muses sing for me\\nSing of Sherman, Montgomery, and Scott\\u202c\\nAnd of Zhukov, and Patton, and the battles they fought\\nWho cleared the path for Presley to sing\\nWho carved the path for Martin Luther King\\nWho did what they did and they went on their way\\nMan, I could tell their stories all day\\nI\\'m falling in love with Calliope\\nShe don\\'t belong to anyone, why not give her to me?\\nShe\\'s speaking to me, speaking with her eyes\\nI\\'ve grown so tired of chasing lies\\nMother of Muses, wherever you are\\nI\\'ve already outlived my life by far\\nMother of Muses, unleash your wrath\\nThings I can\\'t see, they\\'re blocking my path\\nShow me your wisdom, tell me my fate\\nPut me upright, make me walk straight\\nForge my identity from the inside out\\nYou know what I\\'m talking about\\nTake me to the river, release your charms\\nLet me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms\\nWake me, shake me, free me from sin\\nMake me invisible, like the wind\\nGot a mind that ramble, got a mind that roam\\nI\\'m travelin\\' light and I\\'m a-slow coming home They sat together in the park\\nAs the evening sky grew dark\\nShe looked at him and he felt a spark\\nTingle to his bones\\n\\'Twas then he felt alone\\nAnd wished that he\\'d gone straight\\nAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate\\nThey walked alone by the old canal\\nA little confused, I remember well\\nAnd stopped into a strange hotel\\nWith a neon burning bright\\nHe felt the heat of the night\\nHit him like a freight train\\nMoving with a simple twist of fate\\nA saxophone someplace far-off played\\nAs she was walking on by the arcade\\nAs the light bust through a beat-up shade\\nWhere he was wakin\\' up\\nShe dropped a coin into the cup\\nOf a blind man at the gate\\nAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate\\nHe woke up, the room was bare\\nHe didn\\'t see her anywhere\\nHe told himself he didn\\'t care\\nPushed the window open wide\\nFelt an emptiness inside\\nTo which he just could not relate\\nBrought on by a simple twist of fate\\nHe hears the ticking of the clocks\\nAnd walks along with a parrot that talks\\nHunts her down by the waterfront docks\\nWhere the sailors all come in\\nMaybe she\\'ll pick him out again\\nHow long must he wait?\\nOne more time, for a simple twist of fate\\nPeople tell me it\\'s a sin\\nTo know and feel too much within\\nI still believe she was my twin\\nBut I lost the ring\\nShe was born in spring\\nBut I was born too late\\nBlame it on a simple twist of fate My love she speaks like silence\\nWithout ideals or violence\\nShe doesn\\'t have to say she\\'s faithful\\nYet she\\'s true, like ice, like fire\\nPeople carry roses\\nAnd make promises by the hours\\nMy love she laughs like the flowers\\nValentines can\\'t buy her\\nIn the dime stores and bus stations\\nPeople talk of situations\\nRead books, repeat quotations\\nDraw conclusions on the wall\\nSome speak of the future\\nMy love she speaks softly\\nShe knows there\\'s no success like failure\\nAnd that failure\\'s no success at all\\nThe cloak and dagger dangles\\nMadams light the candles\\nIn ceremonies of the horsemen\\nEven a pawn must hold a grudge\\nStatues made of match sticks\\nCrumble into one another\\nMy love winks, she does not bother\\nShe knows too much to argue or to judge\\nThe bridge at midnight trembles\\nThe country doctor rambles\\nBankers\\' nieces seek perfection\\nExpecting all the gifts that wise men bring\\nThe wind howls like a hammer\\nThe night blows rainy\\nMy love she\\'s like some raven\\nAt my window with a broken wing I ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more\\nNo, I ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more\\nWell, I wake up in the morning\\nFold my hands and pray for rain\\nI got a head full of ideas\\nThat are drivin\\' me insane\\nIt\\'s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor\\nI ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more\\nI ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s brother no more\\nNo, I ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s brother no more\\nWell, he hands you a nickel\\nHe hands you a dime\\nHe asks you with a grin\\nIf you\\'re having a good time\\nThen he fines you every time you slam the door\\nI ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s brother no more\\nI ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Pa no more\\nNo, I ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Pa no more\\nWell, he puts his cigar\\nOut in your face just for kicks\\nHis bedroom window\\nIt is made out of bricks\\nThe National Guard stands around his door\\nAh, I ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Pa no more\\nI ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Ma no more\\nNo, I ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Ma no more\\nWell, she talks to all the servants\\nAbout man and God and law\\nEverybody says\\nShe\\'s the brains behind Pa\\nShe\\'s 68, but she says she\\'s 54\\nI ain\\'t gonna work for Maggie\\'s Ma no more\\nI ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more\\nI ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more\\nWell, I try my best\\nTo be just like I am\\nBut everybody wants you\\nTo be just like them\\nThey say \"Sing while you slave\" and I just get bored\\nAh, I ain\\'t gonna work on Maggie\\'s farm no more Oh my name it ain\\'t nothin\\'\\nMy age it means less\\nThe country I come from\\nIs called the Midwest\\nI’s taught and brought up there\\nThe laws to abide\\nAnd that the land that I live in\\nHas God on its side\\nOh the history books tell it\\nThey tell it so well\\nThe cavalries charged\\nThe Indians fell\\nThe cavalries charged\\nThe Indians died\\nAh the country was young\\nWith God on its side\\nThe Spanish-American\\nWar had its day\\nAnd the Civil War too\\nWas soon laid away\\nAnd the names of the heroes\\nI’s made to memorize\\nWith guns in their hands\\nAnd God on their side\\nThe First World War boys\\nIt came and it went\\nThe reason for fightin\\'\\nI never did get\\nBut I learned to accept it\\nAccept it with pride\\nFor you don’t count the dead\\nWhen God’s on your side\\nThe Second World War\\nCame to an end\\nWe forgave the Germans\\nAnd then we were friends\\nThough they murdered six million\\nIn the ovens they fried\\nThe Germans now too\\nHave God on their side\\nI’ve learned to hate the Russians\\nAll through my whole life\\nIf another war comes\\nIt’s them we must fight\\nTo hate them and fear them\\nTo run and to hide\\nAnd accept it all bravely\\nWith God on my side\\nBut now we got weapons\\nOf chemical dust\\nIf fire them we’re forced to\\nThen fire them we must\\nOne push of the button\\nAnd a shot the world wide\\nAnd ya\\' never ask questions\\nWhen God’s on your side\\nThrough many dark hour\\nI been thinking about this\\nThat Jesus Christ\\nWas betrayed by a kiss\\nBut I can’t think for ya\\'\\nYou’ll have to decide\\nWhether Judas Iscariot\\nHad God on his side\\nSo now as I’m leavin\\'\\nI’m weary as Hell\\nThe confusion I’m feelin\\'\\nAin\\'t no tongue can tell\\nThe words fill my head\\nAnd they fall to the floor\\nIf God’s on our side\\nHe’ll stop the next war I’ve seen love go by my door\\nIt’s never been this close before\\nNever been so easy or so slow\\nI\\'ve been shooting in the dark too long\\nWhen something’s not right, it’s wrong\\nYou\\'re gonna make me lonesome when you go\\nDragon clouds so high above\\nI’ve only known careless love\\nIt always just hit me from below\\nBut this time \\'round it’s more correct\\nRight on target, so direct\\nYou\\'re gonna make me lonesome when you go\\nPurple clover, Queen Anne\\'s lace\\nCrimson hair across your face\\nYou could make me cry, if you don’t know\\nCan’t remember what I was thinking of\\nYou might be spoilin’ me too much, love\\nYou\\'re gonna make me lonesome when you go\\nFlowers on the hillside blooming crazy\\nCrickets talking back and forth in rhyme\\nBlue river running slow and lazy\\nI could stay with you forever and never realize the time\\nSituations have ended sad\\nRelationships have all been bad\\nMine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud\\nBut there’s no way I can compare\\nAll them scenes to this affair\\nYou\\'re gonna make me lonesome when you go\\nYou\\'re gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’\\nStaying far behind without you\\nYou\\'re gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’\\nYou\\'re gonna make me give myself a good talking-to\\nI’ll look for you in old Honolulu\\nSan Francisco or Ashtabula\\nYou\\'re gonna have to leave me now, I know\\nBut I’ll see you in the sky above\\nIn the tall grass, in the ones I love\\nYou\\'re gonna make me lonesome when you go I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day\\nOf the most dangerous month of the year\\nAt\\u2005the\\u2005worst time, at\\u2005the worst place\\nThat\\'s all I seem\\u2005to hear\\nI got up early\\nSo I can greet the goddess\\u205fof\\u205fthe\\u205fdawn\\nI\\'ve painted my\\u205fwagon, abandoned all\\u205fhope\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nWell, the Rubicon is a red river\\nGoin\\' gently as she flows\\nRedder than your ruby lips\\nAnd the blood that flows from the rose\\nThree miles north of purgatory\\nOne step from the great beyond\\nI prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nWhat are these dark days I see?\\nIn this world so badly bent\\nI cannot redeem the time\\nThe time so idly spent\\nHow much longer can it last?\\nHow long can it go on?\\nI embrace my love, put down my hair\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nI can feel the bones beneath my skin\\nAnd they\\'re tremblin\\' with rage\\nI\\'ll make your wife a widow\\nYou\\'ll never see old age\\nShow me one good man in sight\\nThat the sun shines down upon\\nI pawned my watch, I paid my debts\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nPut my hide up on a hill\\nWhere some happiness I\\'ll find\\nIf I survive, then let me love\\nLet the hour be mine\\nTake the high road, take the low\\nTake any one you\\'re on\\nI poured the cup, I passed it along\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nWell, you defiled the most lovely flowers\\nIn all her womanhood\\nOthers can be tolerant\\nOthers can be good\\nI\\'ll cut you up with a crooked knife\\nLord, and I\\'ll miss you when you\\'re gone\\nI stood between Heaven and Earth\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nYou won\\'t find any happiness here\\nNo happiness or joy\\nGo back to the gutter, try your luck\\nFind you some nice pretty boy\\nTell me how many men I need\\nAnd who can I count upon\\nI strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nI feel the holy spirit inside\\nSee the light that freedom gives\\nI believe it\\'s in the reach of\\nEvery man who lives\\nKeep as far away as possible\\nIt\\'s darkest \\'fore the dawn \\nI turned the key, I broke it off\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon\\nMona, baby, are you still in my mind?\\nI truly believe that you are\\nCouldn\\'t be anybody else but you\\nWho\\'s come with me this far\\nThe killing frost is on the ground\\nAnd the autumn leaves are gone\\nI lit the torch, I looked to the east\\nAnd I crossed the Rubicon If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\\nShe left here last early Spring, is livin\\' there, I hear\\nSay for me that I\\'m all right though things get kind of slow\\nShe might think that I\\'ve forgotten her, don\\'t tell her it isn\\'t so\\nWe had a falling out, like lovers often will\\nAnd to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill\\nAnd though our separation, it pierced me to the heart\\nShe still lives inside of me, we\\'ve never been apart\\nIf you get close to her, kiss her once for me\\nAlways have respected her for doing what she did and gettin\\' free\\nOh, whatever makes her happy, I won\\'t stand in the way\\nThough the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay\\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\\nAnd I\\'ve never gotten used to it, I\\'ve just learned to turn it off\\nEither I\\'m too sensitive or else I\\'m gettin\\' soft\\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\\nIf she\\'s passin\\' back this way, I\\'m not that hard to find\\nTell her she can look me up if she\\'s got the time Well, I ride on a mail train, baby\\nCan\\'t buy a thrill\\nWell, I been up all night\\nLeanin\\' on the windowsill\\nWell, if I die\\nOn top of the hill\\nAnd if I don’t make it\\nYou know my baby will\\nDon\\'t the moon look good, mama\\nShining through the trees?\\nDon\\'t the brakeman look good, mama\\nFlaggin\\' down the “Double E?”\\nDon\\'t the sun look good\\nGoin\\' down over the sea?\\nBut don’t my gal look fine\\nWhen she\\'s comin\\' after me?\\nNow the wintertime is coming\\nThe windows are filled with frost\\nI went to tell everybody\\nBut I could not get across\\nWell, I want to be your lover, baby\\nI don’t want to be your boss\\nDon’t say I never warned you\\nWhen your train gets lost In Scarlet Town, where I was born\\nThere’s ivy leaf and silver thorn\\nThe streets have names that you can’t pronounce\\nGold is down to a quarter of an ounce\\nThe music starts and

Jane? It was late last night when the boss came home\\nTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throne\\nServant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone\\nShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”\\n“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man\\nCome to the point as straight as you can”\\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan\\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand”\\nThe boss he lay back flat on his bed\\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched his head\\nHe pondered the future of his fate\\nTo wait another day would be far too late\\n“Go fetch me my coat and my tie\\nAnd the cheapest labour that money can buy\\nSaddle me up my buckskin mare\\nIf you see me go by, put up a prayer” \\nWell, they rode all night, and they rode all day\\nEastward, long down the broad highway\\nHis spirit was tired and his vision was bent\\nHis men deserted him and onward he went\\nHe came to a place where the light was dull\\nHis forehead pounding in his skull\\nHeavy heart was racked with pain\\nInsomnia raging in his brain\\nWell, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword\\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his lord\\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall\\nOne way or another put an end to it all\\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire\\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire\\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two\\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who\\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain\\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein\\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air\\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair\\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked\\nOne single unit, inseparably linked\\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by” \\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly” \\nFrom behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor\\nHe moved his feet and he bolted the door\\nShadows hiding the lines in his face\\nWith all the nobility of an ancient race\\nShe turned, she was startled with a look of surprise\\nWith a hatred that could hit the skies\\n“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes\\nTo come this way was by no means wise” \\n“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench\\nAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence\\nYou are making my heart feel sick\\nPut your clothes back on, double-quick” \\n“Silly boy, you think me a saint\\nI’ll listen no more to your words of complaint\\nYou’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies\\nNow hold your tongue and feed your eyes” \\n“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too\\nBut what good would these things do you?\\nBow the heart if not the knee\\nOr never again this world you’ll see” \\n“Oh, please let not your heart be cold\\nThis man is dearer to me than gold” \\n“Oh, my dear, you must be blind\\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” \\n“You’ve had your way too long with me\\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” \\n“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed\\n‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” \\n“Do not let your passion rule\\nYou think my heart the heart of a fool\\nAnd you, sir, you can not deny\\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?” \\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat\\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that\\nLook sharp or step aside\\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” \\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear\\nFirst bullet grazed his ear\\nSecond ball went right straight in\\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin\\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head\\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed\\nIt would take more than needle and thread\\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead\\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend” \\n“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?\\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin\\nI cut him down and threw him to the wind” \\nThis she said with angry breath\\n“You too shall meet the lord of death\\nIt was I who brought your soul to life” \\nThen she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet\\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife\\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” \\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot\\nBut we’re no way similar in body or thought\\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know” \\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow\\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door\\nHis tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor\\nHe whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault\\nMy fighting days have come to a halt” \\nShe touched his lips and kissed his cheek\\nHe tried to speak but his breath was weak\\n“You died for me, now I’ll die for you” \\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it through\\nAll three lovers together in a heap\\nThrown into the grave, forever to sleep\\nFuneral torches blazed away\\nThrough the towns and the villages all night and all day She\\'s got everything she needs\\nShe\\'s an artist, she don\\'t look back\\nShe\\'s got everything she needs\\nShe\\'s an artist, she don\\'t look back\\nShe can take the dark out of the nighttime\\nAnd paint the daytime black\\nYou will start out standing\\nProud to steal her anything she sees\\nYou will start out standing\\nProud to steal her anything she sees\\nBut you will wind up peeking through her keyhole\\nDown upon your knees\\nShe never stumbles\\nShe\\'s got no place to fall\\nShe never stumbles\\nShe\\'s got no place to fall\\nShe\\'s nobody\\'s child\\nThe Law can\\'t touch her at all\\nShe wears an Egyptian ring\\nIt sparkles before she speaks\\nShe wears an Egyptian ring\\nIt sparkles before she speaks\\nShe\\'s a hypnotist collector\\nYou are a walking antique\\nBow down to her on Sunday\\nSalute her when her birthday comes\\nBow down to her on Sunday\\nSalute her when her birthday comes\\nFor Halloween buy her a trumpet\\nAnd for Christmas get her a drum Well, I see you got your\\nBrand new leopard-skin pillbox hat\\nYes, I see you got your\\nBrand new leopard-skin pillbox hat\\nWell, you must tell me, baby\\nHow your head feels under something

even room enough\\nTo be anywhere\\nIt’s not dark yet\\nBut it’s getting there\\nWell, my sense of humanity\\nHas gone down the drain\\nBehind every beautiful thing\\nThere’s been some kind of pain\\nShe wrote me a letter\\nAnd she wrote it so kind\\nShe put down in writing\\nWhat was in her mind\\nI just don’t see why I should even care\\nIt’s not dark yet\\nBut it’s getting there\\nWell, I’ve been to London\\nAnd I’ve been to gay Paris\\nI’ve followed the river\\nAnd I got to the sea\\nI’ve been down on the bottom\\nOf a world full of lies\\nI ain’t looking for nothing\\nIn anyone’s eyes\\nSometimes my burden\\nIs more than I can bear\\nIt’s not dark yet\\nBut it’s getting there\\nI was born here, and I’ll die here\\nAgainst my will\\nI know it looks like I’m moving\\nBut I’m standing still\\nEvery nerve in my body\\nIs so vacant and numb\\nI can’t even remember what it was\\nI came here to get away from\\nDon’t even hear a murmur of a prayer\\nIt’s not dark yet\\nBut it’s getting there Our conversation was short and sweet\\nIt nearly swept me off-a my feet\\nAnd I\\'m back in the rain, oh, oh\\nAnd you are on dry land\\nYou made it there somehow\\nYou\\'re a big girl now\\nBird on the horizon, sitting on a fence\\nHe\\'s singing his song for me at his own expense\\nAnd I\\'m just like that bird, oh, oh\\nSinging just for you\\nI hope that you can hear\\nHear me singing through these tears\\nTime is a jet plane, it moves too fast\\nOh, but what a shame that all we\\'ve shared can\\'t last\\nI can change, I swear, oh, oh\\nSee what you can do\\nI can make it through\\nYou can make it too\\nLove is so simple, to quote a phrase\\nYou\\'ve known it all the time, I\\'m learning it these days\\nOh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\\nIn somebody\\'s room\\nIt\\'s a price I have to pay\\nYou\\'re a big girl all the way\\nA change in the weather is known to be extreme\\nBut what\\'s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\\nI\\'m going out of my mind, oh, oh\\nWith a pain that stops and starts\\nLike a corkscrew to my heart\\nEver since we\\'ve been apart I was riding on the Mayflower\\nWhen I thought I spied some land\\nI yelled for Captain Arab\\nI have you understand\\nWho came running to the deck\\nSaid, \"Boys, forget the whale\\nLook on over yonder\\nCut the engines\\nChange the sail\\nHaul on the bowline\"\\nWe sang that melody\\nLike all tough sailors do\\nWhen they\\'re far away at sea\\n\"I think I\\'ll call it America\"\\nI said as we hit land\\nI took a deep breath\\nI fell down, I could not stand\\nCaptain Arab he started\\nWriting up some deeds\\nHe said, \"Let\\'s set up a fort\\nAnd start buyin\\' a place with beads\"\\nJust then this cop comes down the street\\nCrazy as a loon\\nHe throws us all in jail\\nFor carrying harpoons\\nAh, me I busted out\\nDon\\'t even ask me how\\nI went to get some help\\nI walked by a Guernsey cow\\nWho directed me down\\nTo the Bowery slums\\nWhere people carried signs around\\nSayin\\', \"Ban the bums\"\\nI jumped right into line\\nSayin\\' \"I hope that I\\'m not late\"\\nWhen I realized I hadn\\'t eaten\\nFor five days straight\\nI went into a restaurant\\nLooking for the cook\\nI told him I was the editor\\nOf a famous etiquette book\\nThe waitress he was handsome\\nHe wore a powder blue cape\\nI ordered some Suzette, I said\\n\"Could you please make that Crepe?\"\\nJust then the whole kitchen exploded\\nFrom boilin\\' fat\\nFood was flyin\\' everywhere\\nI left without my hat\\nNow, I didn\\'t mean to be nosy\\nBut I went into a bank\\nTo get some bail for Arab\\nAnd all the boys back in the tank\\nThey asked me for some collateral\\nAnd I pulled down my pants\\nThey threw me in the alley\\nWhen up comes this girl from France\\nWho invited me to her house\\nI went, but she had a friend\\nWho knocked me out\\nAnd robbed my boots\\nAnd I was on the street again\\nWell, I rapped upon a house\\nWith the US flag upon display\\nI said, \"Could you help me out\\nI got some friends down the way\"\\n\"The man says, \"Get out of here\\nI\\'ll tear you limb from limb\"\\nI said, \"You know they refused Jesus, too\"\\nHe said, \"You\\'re not Him\\nGet out of here before I break your bones\\nI ain\\'t your pop\"\\nI decided to have him arrested\\nAnd I went lookin\\' for a cop\\nI ran right outside\\nI hopped inside a cab\\nI went out the other door\\nThis Englishman said, \"Fab\"\\nAs he saw me leap a hot dog stand\\nAnd a chariot that stood\\nParked across from a building\\nAdvertising brotherhood\\nI ran right through the front door\\nLike a hobo sailor does\\nBut it was just a funeral parlor\\nAnd the man asked me who I was\\nI repeated that my friends\\nWere all in jail, with a sigh\\nHe gave me his card\\nHe said, \"Call me if they die\"\\nI shook his hand and said goodbye\\nRan out to the street\\nWhen a bowling ball came down the road\\nAnd knocked me off my feet\\nA pay phone was ringing\\nAnd it just about blew my mind\\nWhen I picked it up and said hello\\nThis foot came through the line\\nWell, by this time I\\'s fed up\\nAt tryin\\' to make a stab\\nAt bringing back any help\\nFor my friends and captain Arab\\nI decided to flip a coin\\nLike either heads or tails\\nWould let me know if I should go\\nBack to ship or back to jail\\nSo I hocked my sailor suit\\nAnd I got a coin to flip\\nIt came up tails\\nIt rhymed with sails\\nSo I made it back to the ship\\nWell, I got back and took\\nThe parking ticket off the mast\\nI was ripping it to shreds\\nWhen this coastguard boat went past\\nThey asked me my name\\nAnd I said, \"Captain Kidd\"\\nThey believed me but\\nThey wanted to know\\nWhat exactly that I did\\nI said for the Pope of Eruke\\nI was employed\\nThey let me go right away\\nThey were very paranoid\\nWell, the last I heard of Arab\\nHe was stuck on a whale\\nThat was married to the deputy\\nSheriff of the jail\\nBut the funniest thing was\\nWhen I was leavin\\' the bay\\nI saw three ships sailin\\'\\nThere were all heading my way\\nI asked the captain what his name was\\nAnd how come he didn\\'t drive a truck\\nHe said his name was Columbus\\nI just said, \"Good luck\" While riding on a train going west\\nI fell asleep for to take my rest\\nI dreamed a dream that made me sad\\nConcerning myself and the first few friends I had\\nWith half-damp eyes I stared to the room\\nWhere my friends and I spent many an afternoon\\nWhere we together weathered many a storm\\nLaughin and singin till the early hours of the morn\\nBy the old wooden stove where our hats was hung\\nOur words was told, our songs was sung\\nWhere we longed for nothing and were satisfied\\nJokin\\' and talkin\\' about the world outside\\nWith hungry hearts through the heat and cold\\nWe never much thought we could get very old\\nWe thought we could sit forever in fun\\nAnd our chances really was a million to one\\nAs easy it was to tell black from white\\nIt was all that easy to tell wrong from right\\nAnd our choices, they was few so the thought never hit\\nThat the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split\\nHow many a year has passed and gone\\nMany a gamble has been lost and won\\nAnd many a road taken by many a first friend\\nAnd each one I’ve never seen again\\nI wish, I wish, I wish in vain\\nThat we could sit simply in that room again\\nTen thousand dollars at the drop of a hat\\nAnd I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that I\\'m searching for phrases\\nTo sing your praises\\nI need to tell someone\\nIt\\'s soon after midnight\\nAnd my day has just begun\\nA gal named Honey\\nTook my money\\nShe was passing by\\nIt\\'s soon after midnight\\nAnd the moon is in my eye\\nMy heart is cheerful\\nIt\\'s never fearful\\nI\\'ve been down on the killing floors\\nI\\'m in no great hurry\\nI\\'m not afraid of your fury\\nI\\'ve faced stronger walls than yours\\nCharlotte\\'s a harlot\\nDresses in scarlet\\nMary dresses in green\\nIt\\'s soon after midnight\\nAnd I\\'ve got a date with the fairy queen\\nThey chirp and they chatter\\nWhat does it matter?\\nThey\\'re lying there dying in their blood\\nTwo-timing Slim\\nWho\\'s ever heard of him\\nI\\'ll drag his corpse through the mud\\nIt\\'s now or never\\nMore than ever\\nWhen I met you I didn\\'t think you would do\\nIt\\'s soon after midnight\\nAnd I don\\'t want nobody but you A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood\\nA finger fired the trigger to his name\\nA handle hid out in the dark\\nA hand set the spark\\nTwo eyes took the aim\\nBehind a man’s brain\\nBut he can’t be blamed\\nHe’s only a pawn in their game\\nA South politician preaches to the poor white man\\n“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain\\nYou’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain\\nAnd the Negro’s name\\nIs used it is plain\\nFor the politician’s gain\\nAs he rises to fame\\nAnd the poor white remains\\nOn the caboose of the train\\nBut it ain\\'t him to blame\\nHe’s only a pawn in their game\\nThe deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid\\nAnd the marshals and cops get the same\\nBut the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool\\nHe’s taught in his school\\nFrom the start by the rule\\nThat the laws are with him\\nTo protect his white skin\\nTo keep up his hate\\nSo he never thinks straight\\n\\'Bout the shape that he’s in\\nBut it ain\\'t him to blame\\nHe’s only a pawn in their game\\nFrom the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks\\nAnd the hoof beats pound in his brain\\nAnd he’s taught how to walk in a pack\\nShoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch\\nTo hang and to lynch\\nTo hide \\'neath the hood\\nTo kill with no pain\\nLike a dog on a chain\\nHe ain\\'t a-got no name\\nBut it ain\\'t him to blame\\nHe’s only a pawn in their game\\nToday, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught\\nThey lowered him down as a king\\nBut when the shadowy sun sets on the one\\nThat fired the gun\\nHe’ll see by his grave\\nOn the stone that remains\\nCarved next to his name\\nHis epitaph plain\\nOnly a pawn in their game If you’re travelin\\' to the north country fair\\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\\nRemember me to one who lives there\\nFor she once was a true love of

long The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall\\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall\\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down\\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\\nHe was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts\\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads\\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\\nBackstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs\\nLily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair\\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide\\nA gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside\\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town\\'s only diamond mine\\nHe made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine\\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\\nShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown\\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\\n“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn\\'t seem to hear\\nHe was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts\\n“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself\\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim\\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\\nStaring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\\nShe had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\\nThe drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\\nNo, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife\\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife\\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died\\nShe was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\\nLily took her dress off, buried it away\\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\\nHave known it would someday\\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”\\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts\\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\\nHe went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk\\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked\\nAnd Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn\\'t say surprised\\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts\\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\\nFor one more member who had business back in town\\nBut they couldn\\'t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\\nThe next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black\\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn\\'t even blink\\nThe hanging judge was sober, he hadn\\'t had a drink\\nThe only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts\\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\\nShe was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\\nThinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law\\nBut most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts A worried man with a worried mind\\nNo one in front of me and nothing behind\\nThere’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne\\nGot white skin, got assassin’s eyes\\nI’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies\\nI’m well dressed, waiting on the last train\\nStanding on the gallows with my head in a noose\\nAny minute now I’m expecting all hell

I should be in Hollywood\\nJust for a second there I thought I saw something move\\nGonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag\\nAin’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag\\nOnly a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove\\nLot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too\\nDon’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through\\nPeople are crazy and times are strange\\nI’m locked in tight, I’m out of range\\nI used to care, but things have changed\\nI’ve been walking forty miles of bad road\\nIf the Bible is right, the world will explode\\nI’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can\\nSome things are too hot to touch\\nThe human mind can only stand so much\\nYou can’t win with a losing hand\\nFeel like falling in love with the first woman I meet\\nPutting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street\\nPeople are crazy and times are strange\\nI’m locked in tight, I’m out of range\\nI used to care, but things have changed\\nI hurt easy, I just don’t show it\\nYou can hurt someone and not even know it\\nThe next sixty seconds could be like an eternity\\nGonna get low down, gonna fly high\\nAll the truth in the world adds up to one big lie\\nI’m in

later, one of us must know\\nThat I really did try to get close to you Buckets of rain\\nBuckets of tears\\nGot all them buckets comin’ out of my ears\\nBuckets of moonbeams in my hand\\nYou got all the love\\nHoney baby, I can stand\\nI been meek\\nAnd hard like an oak\\nI\\'ve seen pretty people disappear like smoke\\nFriends will arrive, friends will disappear\\nIf you want me\\nHoney baby, I’ll be here\\nI like your smile\\nAnd your fingertips\\nI like the way that you move your hips\\nI like the cool way you look at me\\nEverything about you is bringing me misery\\nLittle red wagon\\nLittle red bike\\nI ain’t no monkey, but I know what I like\\nI like the way you love me strong and slow\\nI’m taking you with me\\nHoney baby, when I go\\nLife is sad\\nLife is a bust\\nAll you can do is do what you must\\nYou do what you must do, and you do it well\\nI do it for you\\nHoney baby, can’t you tell? When she said\\n“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”\\nI cried she was deaf\\nAnd she worked on my face until breaking my eyes\\nAn\\' said, “What else you got left?”\\nYeah, it was then that I got up to leave\\nBut she said, “Don’t forget\\nEverybody must give something back\\nFor something they get”\\nI stood there and hummed\\nI tapped on her drum I asked her \"How come?\"\\nAnd she buttoned her boot\\nAnd straightened her suit\\nThen she said, “Don’t get cute”\\nSo I forced my hands in my pockets\\nAnd felt with my thumbs\\nAnd gallantly handed her\\nMy very last piece of gum\\nShe threw me outside\\nI stood in the dirt where everyone walked\\nAnd after finding out I’d\\nForgotten my shirt\\nI went back and knocked\\nI waited in the hallway, she went to get it\\nAnd I tried to make sense\\nOut of that picture of you in your wheelchair\\nThat leaned up against\\nHer Jamaican rum\\nAnd when she did come, I asked her for some\\nShe said, “No, dear”\\nI said, “Your words aren’t clear\\nYou’d better spit out your gum”\\nShe screamed \\'til her face got so red\\nThen she fell on the floor\\nAnd I covered her up and then\\nThought I’d go look through her drawer\\nAnd when I was through\\nI filled up my shoe\\nAnd brought it to you\\nAnd you, you took me in\\nYou loved me then\\nYou never wasted time\\nAnd I, I never took much\\nI never asked for your crutch\\nNow don’t ask for mine It\\'s been such a long long time\\nSince we loved each other when our hearts were true\\nOne time, for one brief day, I was the man for you\\nLast night I heard you talking in your sleep\\nSaying things you shouldn\\'t say, oh baby\\nYou just may have to go to jail someday\\nIs there a place we can go?\\nIs there anybody we can see?\\nMaybe it\\'s the same for you as it is for me\\nI ain\\'t seen my family in twenty years\\nThat ain\\'t easy to understand, they may be dead by now\\nI lost track of em after they lost their land\\nShake it up baby, twist and shout\\nYou know what it\\'s all about\\nWhat are you doing out there in the sun anyway?\\nDon\\'t you know, the sun can burn your brains right out\\nMy enemy crashed into the dust\\nStopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust\\nHe was run down hard and he broke apart\\nHe died in shame, he had an iron heart\\nI wear dark glasses to cover my eyes\\nThere are secrets in em that I can\\'t disguise\\nCome back baby\\nIf I hurt your feelings, I apologize\\nTwo trains running side by side, forty miles wide\\nDown the eastern line\\nYou don\\'t have to go\\nI just came to you because you\\'re a friend of mine\\nI think that when my back was turned\\nThe whole world behind me burned\\nIt\\'s been a while\\nSince we walked down that long, long aisle\\nWe cried on a cold and frosty morn\\nWe cried because our souls were torn\\nSo much for tears\\nSo much for these long and wasted years Sixteen years\\nSixteen banners united over the fields\\nWhere the good shepherd grieves\\nDesperate men, desperate women divided\\nSpreading their wings \\'neath falling leaves\\nFortune calls\\nI stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace\\nMerchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down\\nShe\\'s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born\\nOn Midsummer\\'s Eve near the tower\\nThe cold-blooded moon\\nThe captain waits above the celebration\\nSending his thoughts to a beloved maid\\nWhose ebony face is beyond communication\\nThe captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid\\nThey shaved her head\\nShe was torn between Jupiter and Apollo\\nA messenger arrived with a black nightingale\\nI seen her on the stairs and I couldn\\'t help but follow\\nFollow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil\\nI stumbled to my feet\\nI rode past destruction in the ditches\\nWith the stitches still mending \\'neath a heart-shaped tattoo\\nRenegade priests and treacherous young witches\\nWere handing out the flowers that I\\'d given to you\\nThe palace of mirrors\\nWhere dog soldiers are reflected\\nThe endless road and the wailing of chimes\\nThe empty rooms where her memory is protected\\nWhere the angels\\' voices whisper to the souls of previous times\\nShe wakes him up\\nForty-eight hours later the sun is breaking\\nNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks\\nShe\\'s begging to know what measures he now will be taking\\nHe\\'s pulling her down and she\\'s clutching onto his long golden locks\\nGentlemen, he said I don\\'t need your organization, I\\'ve shined your shoes\\nI\\'ve moved your mountains and marked your cards\\nBut Eden is burning either get ready for elimination\\nOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards\\nPeace will come\\nWith tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire\\nBut will offer no reward when her false idols fall\\nAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating\\nBetween the King and the Queen of Swords I married Isis on the fifth day of May\\nBut I could not hold on to her very long\\nSo I cut off my hair and I rode straight away\\nFor the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong\\nI came to a high place of darkness and light\\nDividing line ran through the center of town\\nI hitched up my pony to a post on the right\\nWent in to a laundry to wash my clothes down\\nA man in the corner approached me for a match\\nI knew right away, he was not ordinary\\nHe said “Are you looking for something easy to catch?”\\nSaid “I got no money”\\nHe said “That ain\\'t necessary”\\nWe set out that night, for the cold in the North\\nI gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word\\nI said “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth\\nI said “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”\\nI was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold\\nI was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace\\nAs we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold\\nI was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless\\nHow she told me that one day we would meet up again\\nAnd things would be different the next time we wed\\nIf I only could hang on and just be her friend\\nI still can’t remember all the best things she said\\nWe came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice\\nHe said “There’s a body I’m trying to find\\nIf I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”\\n\\'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind\\nThe wind it was a-howlin\\', and the snow was outrageous\\nWe chopped through the night\\nAnd we chopped through the dawn\\nWhen he died I was hoping that it wasn’t contagious\\nBut I made up my mind that I had to go on\\nI broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty\\nThere was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I’d been had\\nWhen I saw that my partner was just being friendly\\nWhen I took up his offer I must\\'ve been mad\\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside\\nThrew him down in the hole, and I put back the cover\\nI said a quick prayer, then I felt satisfied\\nThen I rode back to find Isis, just to tell her I love her\\nShe was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise\\nBlinded by sleep, and in need of a bed\\nI came in from the East, with the sun in my eyes\\nI cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead\\nShe said “Where you been?” I said “No place special”\\nShe said “You look different” I said “Well... I guess”\\nShe said “You been gone” I said “That’s only natural”\\nShe said “You going to stay?” I said “If you want me to, yes\"\\nIsis, oh, Isis, you mystical child\\nWhat drives me to you is what drives me insane\\nI still can remember the way that you smiled\\nOn the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain Oxford Town, Oxford Town\\nEverybody’s got their heads bowed down\\nThe sun don’t shine above the ground\\nI am a-going down to Oxford Town\\nHe went down to Oxford Town\\nGuns and clubs followed him down\\nAll because his face was brown\\nBetter get away from Oxford Town\\nOxford Town around the bend\\nCome in to the door, he couldn’t get in\\nAll because of the color of his skin\\nWhat do you think about that, my friend?\\nMe, my girl, my girl’s son\\nWe got met with a tear gas bomb\\nI don’t even know why we come\\nGoing back where we come from\\nOxford Town in the afternoon\\nEverybody singing a sorrowful tune\\nTwo men died beneath the Mississippi moon\\nSomebody better investigate soon I got this graveyard woman, you know\\nShe keeps my kids\\nBut my soulful mama, you know\\nShe keeps me hid\\nShe’s a junkyard angel, and she\\nAlways gives me bread\\nWell, if I go down dyin\\', you know\\nShe bound to put a blanket on my bed\\nWell, when the pipeline gets broken\\nAnd I\\'m lost on the river bridge\\nI’m all cracked up on the highway\\nAnd in the water’s edge\\nHere again she comes, down the thruway\\nReady to sew me up with a thread\\nWell, if I go down dyin\\', you know\\nShe bound to put a blanket on my bed\\nWell, she don’t make me nervous\\nShe don’t talk too much\\nShe walks like Bo Diddley\\nAnd she don’t need no crutch\\nShe keeps this .410\\nAll loaded with lead\\nWell, if I go down dyin\\', you know\\nShe bound to put a blanket on my bed\\nCome on!\\nWell, you know I\\nNeed a steam shovel, mama, to\\nKeep away the dead\\nI need a dump truck, baby, to\\nUnload my head\\nShe brings me everything and more\\nAnd just like I said\\nWell, if I go down dyin\\', you know\\nShe bound to put a blanket on my bed Hollis Brown\\nHe lived on the outside of town\\nHollis Brown\\nHe lived on the outside of town\\nWith his wife and five children\\nAnd his cabin broken down\\nHe looked for work and money\\nAnd he walked a ragged mile\\nHe looked for work and money\\nAnd ya\\' walked a ragged mile\\nYour children are so hungry\\nThat they don’t know how to smile\\nYour baby’s eyes look crazy\\nThey’re a-tugging at your sleeve\\nYour baby’s eyes look crazy\\nThey’re a-tugging at your sleeve\\nYou walk the floor and wonder why\\nWith every breath you breathe\\nThe rats have got your flour\\nBad blood it got your mare\\nThe rats have got your flour\\nBad blood it got your mare\\nIf there’s anyone that knows\\nIs there anyone that cares?\\nHe prayed to the Lord above\\nOh please send you a friend\\nHe prayed to the Lord above\\nOh please send you a friend\\nYour empty pockets tell ya\\'\\nThat you ain’t a-got no friend\\nYour babies are crying louder now\\nIt’s a-poundin\\' on your brain\\nYour babies are crying louder now\\nIt’s a-poundin\\' on your brain\\nYour wife’s screams are stabbin\\' ya\\'\\nLike the dirty drivin\\' rain\\nYour grass is turnin\\' black\\nThere’s no water in your well\\nYour grass is turnin\\' black\\nThere’s no water in your well\\nYou spent your last lone dollar\\nOn seven shotgun shells\\nWay out in the wilderness\\nA cold coyote calls\\nWay out in the wilderness\\nA cold coyote calls\\nYour eyes fix on the shotgun\\nThat’s hanging on the wall\\nYour brain is a-bleedin\\'\\nAnd your legs can’t seem to stand\\nYour brain is a-bleedin\\'\\nAnd your legs can’t seem to stand\\nYour eyes fix on the shotgun\\nThat you’re holding in your hand\\nThere’s seven breezes blowin\\'\\nAll around the cabin door\\nThere’s seven breezes blowin\\'\\nAll around the cabin door\\nSeven shots ring out\\nLike the ocean’s poundin\\' roar\\nThere’s seven people dead\\nOn a South Dakota farm\\nThere’s seven people dead\\nOn a South Dakota farm\\nSomewheres in the distance\\nThere’s seven new people born Come an\\' gather \\'round friends\\nAnd I\\'ll tell ya\\' a tale\\nOf when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty\\nBut the cardboard filled windows\\nAnd old men on the benches\\nTell you now that the whole town is empty\\nIn the north end of town\\nMy own children are grown\\nWell I was raised on the other\\nIn the wee hours of youth\\nMy mother took sick\\nAnd I was brought up by my brother\\nThe iron ore poured\\nAs the years passed the door\\nThe drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin\\'\\n\\'Til one day my brother\\nFailed to come home\\nThe same as my father before him\\nWell a long winter\\'s wait\\nFrom the winda\\' I watched\\nMy friends they couldn\\'ta been kinder\\nAnd my school it was cut\\nAs I quit in the spring\\nTo marry John Thomas, a miner\\nOh the years passed again\\nAnd the givin\\' was good\\nWith the lunch bucket filled every season\\nWhat with three babies born\\nThe work was cut down\\nTo a half a day\\'s shift with no reason\\nThen the shaft was soon shut\\nAnd more work was cut\\nAnd the fire in the air, it felt frozen\\n\\'Til a man come to speak\\nAnd he said in one week\\nThat number eleven was closin\\'\\nThey complained in the East\\nThey\\'re payin\\' too high\\nThey say that your ore ain\\'t worth a-diggin\\'\\nThat it\\'s much cheaper down\\nIn the South American towns\\nWhere the miners work almost for nothin\\'\\nSo the minin\\' gates locked\\nAnd the red iron rotted\\nAnd the room smelled heavy from drinkin\\'\\nWhen the sad silent song\\nMade the hour twice as long\\nAs I waited for the sun to go sinking\\nI lived by the window\\nAs he talked to himself\\nThis silence of tongues it was buildin\\'\\n\\'Til one morning\\'s wake\\nThe bed it was bare\\nAnd I\\'s left alone with three children\\nThe summer is gone\\nThe ground\\'s turning cold\\nThe stores one by one they\\'re a-foldin\\'\\nMy children will go\\nAs soon they grow\\nWell there ain\\'t nothin\\' here now to hold them Perhaps it\\'s the color of the sun cut flat\\nAnd covering the crossroads I\\'m standing at\\nOr maybe it\\'s the weather or something like that\\nBut mama you been on my mind\\nI don\\'t mean trouble please don\\'t put me down or get upset\\nI am not pleading, or saying I can\\'t forget you\\nI do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet\\nMama you been on my mind\\nEven though my eyes are hazy\\nAnd my thoughts they might be narrow\\nWhere you been don\\'t bother me\\nOr bring me down with sorrow\\nI don\\'t even mind who you\\'ll be waking with tomorrow\\nMama you\\'re just on my mind\\nI\\'m not asking you to say words like yes or no\\nPlease, understand me, I have no place I\\'m calling you to go\\nI\\'m just whispering to myself so I can\\'t pretend that I don\\'t know\\nMama you are on my mind\\nWhen you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror\\nYou know I won\\'t be next to you, you know I won\\'t be near\\nI\\'d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear\\nAs someone who has had you on his mind Down the street the dogs are barkin\\'\\nAnd the day is a-gettin\\' dark\\nAs the night comes in a-falling\\nThe dogs will lose their bark\\nAnd the silent night will shatter\\nFrom the sounds inside my mind\\nYes I’m one too many mornings\\nAnd a thousand miles behind\\nFrom the crossroads of my doorstep\\nMy eyes start to fade\\nAnd I turn my head back to the room\\nWhere my love and I have laid\\nAnd I gaze back to the street\\nThe sidewalk and the sign\\nAnd I’m one too many mornings\\nAnd a thousand miles behind\\nIt’s a restless hungry feeling\\nThat don’t mean no one no good\\nWhen everything I’m a-sayin\\'\\nYou can say it just as good\\nYou’re right from your side\\nI\\'m right from mine\\nWe’re both just one too many mornings\\nAnd a thousand miles behind Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble\\nAncient footprints are everywhere\\nYou can almost think that you’re seeing double\\nOn a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs\\nGot to hurry on back to my hotel room\\nWhere I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece\\nShe promised that she’d be right there with me\\nWhen I paint my masterpiece\\nOh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum\\nDodging lions and wasting time\\nOh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them\\nYes, it sure has been a long, hard climb\\nTrain wheels running through the back of my memory\\nWhen I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese\\nSomeday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody\\nWhen I paint my masterpiece\\nSailing round the world in a dirty gondola\\nOh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!\\nI left Rome and landed in Brussels\\nOn a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried\\nClergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels\\nEveryone was there to greet me when I stepped inside\\nNewspapermen eating candy\\nHad to be held down by big police\\nSomeday, everything is going to be different\\nWhen I paint my masterpiece There is a house down in New Orleans\\nThey call the Rising Sun.\\nAnd it\\'s been the ruin of many a-poor girl\\nAnd me—oh, God—I\\'m one\\nMy mother was a tailor\\nShe sewed these new blue jeans\\nMy sweetheart was a gambler, Lord\\nDown in New Orleans\\nNow the only thing a gambler needs\\nIs a suitcase and a trunk\\nAnd the only time he\\'s satisfied\\nIs when he\\'s on a drunk\\nHe fills his glasses up to the brim\\nAnd he\\'ll pass the cards around\\nAnd the only pleasure he gets out of life\\nIs ramblin\\' from town to town\\nOh, tell my baby sister\\nNot to do what I have done!\\nBut shun that house in New Orleans\\nThey call the Rising Sun\\nWell it\\'s one foot on the platform\\nThe other foot on the train!\\nI\\'m goin\\' back to New Orleans\\nTo wear that ball and chain\\nI\\'m a goin\\' back to New Orleans\\nMy race is almost run!\\nI\\'m goin\\' back to end my life\\nDown in the Rising Sun\\nThere is a house in New Orleans\\nThey call the Rising Sun\\nIt\\'s been the ruin of many a-poor girl\\nAnd me—oh, God—I\\'m one Corrina, Corrina\\nGirl, where you been so long?\\nCorrina, Corrina\\nGirl, where you been so long?\\nI been worrying about you, baby\\nBaby, please come home\\nI got a bird that whistles\\nI got a bird that sings\\nI got a bird that whistles\\nI got a bird that sings\\nBut I ain\\'t got Corrina\\nLife don’t mean a thing\\nCorrina, Corrina\\nGirl, you’re on my mind\\nCorrina, Corrina\\nGirl, you’re on my mind\\nI’m a-sittin down thinkin of you\\nI just can’t keep from crying Clouds so swift, rain won’t lift\\nGate won’t close, railings froze\\nGet your mind off wintertime\\nYou ain’t goin\\' nowhere\\nWhoo-ee! Ride me high\\nTomorrow’s the day\\nMy bride’s going to come\\nOh, oh, are we going to fly\\nDown in the easy chair!\\nI don’t care how many letters they sent\\nMorning came and morning went\\nPick up your money and pack up your tent\\nYou ain’t going nowhere\\nWhoo-ee!

Ride me high\\nTomorrow’s the day\\nMy bride’s going to come\\nOh, oh, are we going to fly\\nDown in the easy chair! \\'Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago\\nWhen a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door\\nThis boy\\'s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well\\nThe color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till\\nSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up\\nThey said they had a reason, but I can\\'t remember what\\nThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat\\nThere was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street\\nThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain\\nAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain\\nThe reason that they killed him there, and I\\'m sure it ain\\'t no lie\\nWas just for the fun of killing\\' him and to watch him slowly die\\nAnd then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial\\nTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till\\nBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime\\nAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind\\nI saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see\\nThe smiling brothers walking\\' down the courthouse stairs\\nFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free\\nWhile Emmett\\'s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea\\nIf you can\\'t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that\\'s so unjust\\nYour eyes are filled with dead men\\'s dirt, your mind is filled with dust\\nYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow\\nFor you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!\\nThis song\\'s just a reminder to remind your fellow man\\nThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan\\nBut if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give\\nWe could make this great land of ours a greater place to live Seen the arrow on the doorpost\\nSaying, “This land is condemned\\nAll the way from New Orleans\\nTo Jerusalem”\\nI traveled through East Texas\\nWhere many martyrs fell\\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\\nLike Blind Willie McTell\\nWell, I heard that hoot owl singing\\nAs they were taking down the tents\\nThe stars above the barren trees\\nWas his only audience\\nThem charcoal gypsy maidens\\nCan strut their feathers well\\nBut nobody can sing the blues\\nLike Blind Willie McTell\\nSee them big plantations burning\\nHear the cracking of the whips\\nSmell that sweet magnolia blooming\\nSee the ghosts of slavery ships\\nI can hear them tribes moaning\\nHear that undertaker’s bell\\nNobody can sing the blues\\nLike Blind Willie McTell\\nThere’s a woman by the river\\nWith some fine young handsome man\\nHe’s dressed up like a squire\\nBootlegged whiskey in his hand\\nThere’s a chain gang on the highway\\nI can hear them rebels yell\\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\\nLike Blind Willie McTell\\nWell, God is in His heaven\\nAnd we all want what’s His\\nBut power and greed and corruptible seed\\nSeem to be all that there is\\nI’m gazing out the window\\nOf the St. James Hotel\\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\\nLike Blind Willie McTell Standing on the waters casting your bread\\nWhile the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing\\nDistant ships sailing into the mist\\nYou were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing\\nFreedom just around the corner for you\\nBut with the truth so far off, what good will it do?\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman\\nSo swiftly the sun sets in the sky\\nYou rise up and say goodbye to no one\\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread\\nBoth of their futures, so full of dread, you don\\'t show one\\nShedding off one more layer of skin\\nKeeping one step ahead of the persecutor within\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman\\nYou\\'re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds\\nManipulator of crowds, you\\'re a dream twister\\nYou\\'re going to Sodom and Gomorrah\\nBut what do you care? Ain\\'t nobody there would want to marry your sister\\nFriend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame\\nYou look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman\\nWell, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy\\nThe law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers\\nIn the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed\\nMichelangelo indeed could\\'ve carved out your features\\nResting in the fields, far from the turbulent space\\nHalf asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman\\nWell, the rifleman\\'s stalking the sick and the lame\\nPreacherman seeks the same, who\\'ll get there first is uncertain\\nNightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks\\nMolotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain\\nFalse-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin\\nOnly a matter of time till night comes stepping in\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman\\nIt\\'s a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey\\nA woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet\\nHe\\'ll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat\\nTake the motherless children off the street\\nAnd place them at the feet of a harlot\\nOh, Jokerman, you know what he wants\\nOh, Jokerman, you don\\'t show any response\\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman'"
